About SSCP
The Systems Security Certified Practitioner (SSCP) is the ideal certification for those with proven technical skills and practical, hands-on security knowledge in operational IT roles. It provides confirmation of a practitioner’s ability to implement, monitor and administer IT infrastructure in accordance with information security policies and procedures that ensure data confidentiality, integrity and availability.
The broad spectrum of topics included in the SSCP Common Body of Knowledge (CBK) ensure its relevancy across all disciplines in the field of information security. Successful candidates are competent in the following domains:
•	Security Concepts and Practices
•	Access Controls
•	Risk Identification, Monitoring, and Analysis
•	Incident Response and Recovery
•	Cryptography
•	Network and Communications Security
•	Systems and Application Security
Experience Requirements
Candidates must have a minimum of one year cumulative work experience in one or more of the domains of the SSCP CBK. A one year prerequisite pathway will be granted for candidates who received a degree (bachelors or masters) in a cybersecurity program.
A candidate that doesn’t have the required experience to become an SSCP may become an Associate of ISC2 by successfully passing the SSCP examination. The Associate of ISC2 will then have two years to earn the one year required experience. You can learn more about SSCP experience requirements and how to account for part-time work and internships at www.isc2.org/Certifications/SSCP/SSCP-Experience-Requirements.
Accreditation
SSCP is in compliance with the stringent requirements of ANSI/ISO/IEC Standard 17024.
Job Task Analysis (JTA)
ISC2 has an obligation to its membership to maintain the relevancy of the SSCP. Conducted at regular intervals, the Job Task Analysis (JTA) is a methodical and critical process of determining the tasks that are performed by security professionals who are engaged in the profession defined by the SSCP. The results of the JTA are used to update the examination. This process ensures that candidates are tested on the topic areas relevant to the roles and responsibilities of today’s practicing information security professionals.

Important Information on ISC2 Exams
•	One of the benefits to candidates taking an examination via Computer-Based Testing is that most candidates receive their scores immediately upon completing their examination. In some cases, ISC2 must conduct periodic psychometric analyses prior to releasing exam results.

You may not receive feedback from us on your application directly, but please know that it’s being evaluated, and you’ll hear from us as soon as the review process is complete. If you’re selected for an interview, you’ll be notified by someone on the recruiting team. You can view your application status updates through your Action Center. If you see the job moved to an Archived state, that means the position is either no longer open, you withdrew from consideration, or you were not selected for the role. You may notice that we move your application from one role to another. This may happen a few times and is a normal part of our recruiting process. So, if you see the job you applied to in an Archived state, and a new job listed as Active, please know that this is normal and does not negatively impact your candidacy in any way. How’s your profile? A key part of the review process is evaluating your profile in relation to the job requirements, so please make sure your profile is accurate and extensive – it’s our first step in getting to know you! You can build your profile anyway you’d like – you can import it from LinkedIn, manually update it, or import/attach a resume. The most important thing is that your profile tells your story!

You may not receive feedback from us on your application directly, but please know that it’s being evaluated, and you’ll hear from us as soon as the review process is complete. If you’re selected for an interview, you’ll be notified by someone on the recruiting team. You can view your application status updates through your Action Center. If you see the job moved to an Archived state, that means the position is either no longer open, you withdrew from consideration, or you were not selected for the role. You may notice that we move your application from one role to another. This may happen a few times and is a normal part of our recruiting process. So, if you see the job you applied to in an Archived state, and a new job listed as Active, please know that this is normal and does not negatively impact your candidacy in any way. How’s your profile? A key part of the review process is evaluating your profile in relation to the job requirements, so please make sure your profile is accurate and extensive – it’s our first step in getting to know you! You can build your profile anyway you’d like – you can import it from LinkedIn, manually update it, or import/attach a resume. The most important thing is that your profile tells your story!

Looking for more power- and energy-related content? This 
bonus edition of ElektorMag features additional content to 
inspire you to design your own solutions. As usual, we include 
articles on other interesting topics as well. 
Is your grid supply steadily available? The article, “Mains Power 
Outages Monitor,” details a circuit that constantly monitors 
mains power and signals outages. 
Before high-power semiconductor-based recti! ers, converting 
AC to DC in industrial and transportation applications was a 
signi! cant challenge. Devices were bulky, fragile, used polluting 
materials, and demanded frequent maintenance. Check out 
the article, “Mercury Recti! ers,” to learn about mercury arc 
recti! ers and more. 
Brush-type DC motors are often replaced by brushless 
(BLDC) and stepper motors, but their simpler control still has 
advantages. The article, “Speed Control of a Brushed DC Motor,” 
explores maintaining constant speed regardless of torque — 
without a tachometer generator. 
We hope you enjoy these articles and rest of the content in 
the Bonus edition. As you work on your own projects, be

• Displays and Touchgenerator unit is larger and more expensive 
than a tacholess version of a motor. 
  
If the motor is operated with a pulsed 
voltage (PWM), however, the speed is 
proportional to the duty cycle. At the same 
time, the motor operates as a generator in 
the off-phase of the PWM voltage so that its 
speed can be measured in this phase. In the 
past, in the analog age, the electronic effort 
for such a control was not insignificant, as 
can be seen from the schematic diagram 
in Figure 5. 
  
A rectangle generator, a voltage-controlled 
pulse width modulator, a sample-and-hold 
circuit to measure the actual speed value, 
and a PI controller were required. In the 
digital world, the principle remains the 
same, but the effort required is consid
erably reduced thanks to the use of a 
microcontroller. 
By Rainer Schuster (Germany) 
Brush-type DC motors 
are increasingly being 
replaced by their brushless 
(BLDC) and stepper motor 
competitors. However, 
their use still makes some 
sense, as the control effort 
is considerably lower. This 
article shows how to keep 
the speed of a DC motor with 
brushes constant regardless 
of the torque – and without a 
tachometer generator. 
  
In the simplest case, a DC motor is connected 
to a variable voltage supply, as shown in 
Figure 1. The speed is (theoretically) propor
tional to the supply voltage VM, but only as 
long as the torque is constant. Unfortu
nately, the equivalent circuit diagram of the 
DC motor looks like Figure 2. The motor 
winding not only has an inductance LM, but 
also an ohmic resistance of the copper wire, 
which is designated by RM. The higher the 
torque, the more voltage drops across RM, 
until finally there is no more voltage across 
the inductance LM and the motor stops 
(Figure 3). 
  
Control with Tachogenerator or 
EMF Measurement 
To compensate for these torque-dependent 
speed fluctuations, the motor was once 
usually coupled to a tachogenerator, which 
in turn supplied a voltage proportional to the 
speed (Figure 4). However, a motor-tacho

Practical Implementation of an 
EMF Control 
As the complete circuit diagram in 
Figure 6 shows, an ATtiny45 microcon
troller from Microchip with 4 kB of flash 
memory is used for control. The controller 
has only eight pins, but is perfectly suited 
for this application. It can be programmed 
“in system” via SV2 using an ISP program
ming device. 
  
The microcontroller is supplied with 5 V by 
the voltage regulator IC2, which is why the 
input voltage (and thus the motor voltage) 
must not exceed 24 V. Q1 and Q2 control 
the motor. Q2 is a PMOS transistor of the 
type IRF4905, which can theoretically 
handle a motor current of 74 A, but only if a 
sufficiently dimensioned heat sink is used. 
Figure 7 shows what happens at the motor 
terminals during the different phases of 
the PWM signal: After the ON phase of the 
PWM signal, a demagnetization period 
follows in the OFF phase; then the motor 
generates an EMF voltage that is propor
tional to the speed. This voltage is fed to 
the ADC2 analog-to-digital converter of 
the microcontroller via the R4/R5 voltage 
divider. R5 should be dimensioned so that 
the voltage at ADC2 does not exceed 5 V.

The setpoint speed, which is set by the RPM 
potentiometer or an external voltage of 
0…5 V at X6, is sent to ADC1 of the micro
controller. Diode D1 is absolutely neces
sary because when the control voltage is 
switched off, the inductance of the motor 
discharges, which results in a negative 
voltage spike that D1 limits to about 0.7 V. 
Figure 8 shows a suggested printed circuit 
board layout for the motor control with 
EMF measurement; the required compo
nents are listed in the Component List. 
  
Software I 
The software for the ATtiny45 was written in 
BASCOM. The controller is operated inter
nally at 8 MHz. Timer0 is operated as a PWM 
timer in Phase Correct PWM Timer mode.

10kWith a prescaler of N  =  64, the PWM 
frequency is: 
  
At 8 MHz, this results in a frequency of 
245 Hz. The pulse width is set via register 
PWM0A from 0 to 255. 
  
Depending on the motor type, the prescaler 
may need to be set to 256, for example if 
the induction phase is longer than or the 
same length as the switch-off phase. This 
results in a PWM frequency of approxi
mately 60 Hz. 
  
In the main program loop, the speed 
setpoint is constantly read in at ADC1. The 
actual value is read in at ADC2 during the 
off-phase (Pwm_Pin=0) and summed up. 
When the motor is switched on again, the 
average of the actual value is calculated. 
  
To implement the PI controller, there is 
the constant Ti (integration time), together 
with the time constant of Timer1 and Kp 
(proportional gain), which must be adapted 
to the motor used. The interrupt time of 
Timer1 is set using the TCCR1 register: 
TCCR1 
Timer1 Interrupt 
4 
250 µs 
5 
500 µs 
6 
1 ms 
7 
2 ms 
When Ti has expired (Timer1-Interrupt × Ti ), 
the speed deviation is calculated, added to the 
previous value (taking into account the sign) 
and multiplied by Kp. The result is output 
directly as the new switch-on duration. 
  
Control Using RI Compensation 
Another practical solution can be what is 
known as RI compensation. As mentioned 
at the beginning, the speed fluctuation of a 
DC motor is due to the ohmic resistance of 
its copper winding. If the current through 
the motor is measured, this resistance can 
be compensated. To do this, only the coil 
resistance of the motor needs to be known, 
which can be easily measured. 
  
The circuit in Figure 9 is similar to that in 
Figure 6, except that the motor current is 
measured as a voltage drop across R5. R5 
is to be dimensioned so that a maximum 
of 0.5 V is dropped across R5 at maximum 
motor current. The power dissipation in 
watts must be equal to R5 × motor current 
squared. Figure 10 shows a suggested 
layout for the motor control with RI 
compensation.

Software II 
The software for the RI compensation is 
also written in BASCOM. Timer0 is config
ured as a PWM timer with a frequency of 
245 Hz. In contrast to the EMF control, 
the control here is designed as a pure P 
controller. To do this, the coil resistance 
of the motor and the supply voltage must 
be known and specified as constants RM 
and U0 in the program. 
  
The motor current is now measured during 
the switch-on phase of the PWM signal. 
The effective value of the current is calcu
lated from the switch-on duration: 
  
The duty cycle is then increased by the 
corresponding value. 
  
Two Options 
There are several ways to control a DC 
motor without a tachogenerator. Each of 
these options has different advantages and 
disadvantages:

The MCU obviously requires a separate power supply that 
is independent of the EN input; due to the low-energy 
requirement, a linear regulator is the most economical 
solution here. In general, the concept is completely 
component-agnostic; the author likes to use modern 
PIC16F derivatives from Microchip. 
Figure 2 shows the sub-circuit that informs the PIC when 
the SBC (OPI = Orange Pi) is supplied by the external 
switching regulator (EXT). D1a, R9 and D7a implement 
a more or less “classic” attenuator, which breaks down 
input voltages in the range of up to 20 V to a value that 
is “manageable” for the inputs of process computer and 
microcontroller. 
Splitting the series resistor into the values R7 and R9 is 
necessary because single board computers sometimes 
become a low-impedance load or have a residual voltage 
when they are switched o" — without the resistor, this 
Single-board computers with Unix capability facilitate the 
development of complex control systems. Especially in 
scenarios with high demands on GUI and data process
ing, they are superior to microcontrollers (MCUs). Unfortu
nately, power consumption and real-time capability leave 
some room for improvement. But why not combine the 
best of both worlds? If you want to trim an o" -the-shelf 
single-board computer to be economical, you can achieve 
this with an eight-bitter as a partner. As an example, we 
want to implement a system that adheres to programmed 
downtimes and carries out an “alarm start” in response 
to a specific external event. 
The Circuit Concept 
In principle, the circuit works as shown in the flowchart 
(Figure 1). The voltage regulator acting as the main supply 
for the process computer (usually a switching regulator) is 
controlled by the microcontroller via its Enable input (EN). 
By Tam Hanna (Hungary) 
Raspberry Pis and other SBCs are ideal for 
sophisticated process control, but require 
signi! cantly more power than microcontrollers. Why 
not combine the best of both worlds? Here we show 
you how to get an 8-bit PIC to switch on a Raspberry Pi 
whenever it is needed.

100kwould cause the power management microcontroller 
(connected via the PIC terminal) to see strange or invalid 
values. 
R7 is an additional protective element — the inputs of the 
process computer are connected to the supply voltage 
and ground via protective diodes. When very high voltage 
levels occur, R7 ensures that the current flowing into 
these diodes is limited and the process computer is 
not damaged — C13 and R8 provide a small additional 
debouncing function. 
It should be noted that the circuit shown here with its EXT 
input was connected “directly” to the vehicle electrical 
system in various school buses. As there are now several 
thousands of such systems on the market without failures, 
it has been proven to work. 
The role of diode D1a as reverse polarity protection is also 
helpful — please believe the author, who also works in 
the logistics sector, that connecting batteries the wrong 
way round is one of the classic “sports” of a mechanic. 
The Software Is the Key 
Communication via I2C is generally unproblematic (but 
don’t forget the necessary pull-ups). The “secret” of this 
system lies in the software. The PIC implements a kind 
of state machine that is based on the states shown in 
Figure 3. 
The implementation of the shutdown process is of partic
ular importance. Unixoid operating systems tend not to 
react very kindly to rough shutdowns. A convenient and 
practical way to solve the problem is to implement a 
countdown timer: The SBC activates this countdown 
and then starts the shutdown of the operating system. 
After the (generously dimensioned) period of time has 
elapsed, the process computer is “inertialized” and can 
be disconnected from the power supply. 
Of course, the PIC can also perform other tasks. In 
addition to storing serial numbers and other informa
tion (in order to make it harder to manipulate), it is also 
possible, for example, to perform basic control tasks on 
the PIC. Of course, more complex implementations are 
also possible: A complex MSR task, for example, would 
make a 32-bit MCU appear reasonable as the second
ary controller. 
Practical Experience 
Trackers based on the circuit concept shown here are 
now being used in tens of thousands by one of the 
author’s customers, demonstrating the practical value 
of the design. Instead of a stand-by power consumption 
of around 200 mA, the system now gets by with just 
a few milliamperes. The author’s AN4121, published by 
Microchip, is available at [1] and provides further infor
mation on the topic.

sharing with the owner of an installation at 
another location. For a communal instal
lation, you need a two-thirds majority of 
the co-owners, good luck with that, I would 
say; as a tenant, you should try to convince 
your landlord eventually. And regarding 
energy sharing, that is hardly appealing 
because it is complex, cumbersome and 
above all expensive. It is possible to have a 
small PV installation in Belgium, but you 
have to follow the same procedures as for 
traditional larger installations. With a "xed 
connection to a separate group in the distri
bution cabinet, the necessary inspections 
and bureaucracy, the costs rise considerably, 
and your pro" ts melt like snow in the sun. 
However, there is light at the end of the 
tunnel and from May 2025, plug-in solar 
panels would — "nally — be allowed in 
Belgium after all. The question, of course, 
is how strict the conditions and modalities 
will be. With a bit of bad luck, you will have 
to be able to present an inspection report 
of your electrical installation, and you run 
the risk of having a “smart” meter shoved 
down your throat. 
Belgians are rather risk-avoiding, and this 
is also re# ected at the policy and regula
tory level. In my opinion, it would be better 
to ban extension cords with a power strip, 
electric bikes, electric scooters and hover
boards. These have been in the news several 
times in the context of house "res and with 
the last two devices, you can have serious 
accidents too. I was reminded of this

THE SERIES 
Rectifiers — those are like diodes, right? Well, yes. But these are not 
the kind of diodes you’d use in your crystal radio. Or even for your 
Raspberry Pi power supply. Or even for that super-duper 200 W per 
channel amplifier you’ve been building. Think electric trains, subway 
systems, broadcast transmitters. BIG stu" . As Crocodile Dundee might 
say, ”That’s not a rectifier, THIS is a rectifier!” 
Liquid Mercury 
Mercury-Arc rectifiers make use of the fact that if a pool of liquid 
mercury with some mercury vapor is used as a cathode, an arc can 
be drawn from a carbon anode above it, but the process does not 
work the other way around. 
Hence, rectification. This is su" iciently electronic to justify their inclu
sion in this column, even though they’re not the kind of component 
that’s ever been used in an Elektor project. 
Mercury-arc rectifiers were invented in 1902 by Peter Cooper Hewitt, 
an American electrical engineer who had invented mercury vapor 
lamps (the forerunners of our fluorescent lamps) in 1901. They were 
developed in the early 1900s and rapidly became the go-to solution 
for high-voltage, high current rectification. The arc voltage is around 
20…30 V, and the simplicity of their construction makes them e" icient 
and reliable. They were used up to the 1970s, when semiconductor 
rectifiers and thyristors that were up to the same job became available. 
Some were used until 2012. A typical 6-phase rectifier operating is 
shown in Figure 1. 
Mercury Recti! ers 
By David Ashton (Australia) 
Before the advent of high-power 
semiconductor-based recti! ers, 
transforming alternating current to 
DC in industrial and transportation 
! elds was no mean task! The devices 
were huge, fragile, contained highly 
polluting materials, and required 
frequent maintenance.

Ignitor Electrode 
Ignition has to be started by an ignitor electrode, which usually has to 
briefly come into contact with the mercury. This is done by a number 
of means, including electromagnets, bimetallic strips, etc. Once the 
arc has been struck to cause mercury vapor to form, rectification can 
take place. 
Most mercury-arc rectifiers were 3 or 6-phase, but single-phase recti
fiers needed an excitation electrode to keep the process going. The 
whole assembly is built within a large glass bulb, which allows the

mercury vapor to condense and flow back to the cathode pool. The 
construction of a typical rectifier is shown in Figure 2. 
A typical 6-phase, 150 A rectifier was around 600 mm tall and about 
300 mm round. Above 500 A steel tanks were used with ceramic insula
tors for the electrodes, and these were rated up to several thousand 
amps. Ratings up to several kV were available, higher with special 
construction techniques, but these required frequent maintenance. 
The mercury arcs emit a lot of ultraviolet light, you could get sunburned 
while working around them. Additionally, the noise from them and the 
associated transformers was considerable. Mercury is highly toxic and 
extensive clean-up work is often needed to remove traces of mercury 
when decommissioning them.

the Future 
The global solar energy market is on a positive growth trajectory 
as the solar energy industry is in a constant state of evolution. By 
2030, installed renewable electricity generation capacity under 
the IRENA 1.5°C Scenario (see textbox on next page) is expected 
to more than double, with solar PV contributing 49% of the total 
capacity compared to 40% in 2023 [1]. This translates to an 
increase from 4,085 GW in 2023 to 11,173 GW by 2030, driven by 
annual additions averaging 558 GW per year. 
Challenges and Opportunities 
Achieving the 2030 targets will require robust innovation and 
investment. The solar sector’s ability to sustain its current 
momentum hinges on continued advancements in technologies 
like bifacial panels, floating solar farms, and AI-optimized 
energy systems. These innovations will enhance e! iciency and 
integration, ensuring solar’s key role in a clean energy future.

Green hydrogen production, conversion, and end uses. [3] 
Another critical enabler has emerged for 
sectors that are challenging to electrify, 
such as heavy industry and long-haul 
transport, and that one is hydrogen. 
According to IRENA, hydrogen could 
fulfill 12% of global energy demand under 
the 1.5°C Scenario [3], with applications 
spanning transport, power generation, and 
heating. 
However, its production methods vary 
widely in environmental impact, earning 
the labels grey, blue, and green depending 
on the CO2 emissions involved. Currently, 
96% of global hydrogen production 
relies on fossil fuels (grey hydrogen), 
underscoring the need for a rapid 
transition to cleaner methods [4]. The high 
costs of production for green hydrogen, 
and substantial energy losses during 
production, storage, and conversion 
make it less e! icient than alternatives like 
batteries, while increasing blue hydrogen 
depends on costly carbon capture 
technologies. 
Hydrogen: Main Ingredient for Decarbonization 
12% 
of global energy demand 
could be fulfilled by hydrogen 
under the 1.5°C Scenario. 
96% 
of current share of hydrogen 
is produced from fossil fuels 
(grey hydrogen). 
What Is IRENA’s 1.5°C Scenario? 
IRENA stands for the International Renewable Energy Agency, an intergovernmental organization that promotes the adoption 
and sustainable use of renewable energy worldwide. The IRENA 1.5°C Scenario in the World Energy Transitions Outlook 
presents a pathway to achieve the 1.5°C climate target by 2050 [2]. Achieving this target requires substantial investments 
in clean energy technologies, such as solar, wind, and storage, to decarbonize global energy systems.

January & February 2025 17This design addresses the need to monitor service interruptions, 
whether caused by technical issues — such as infrastructure mainte
nance — or by malicious intruders tampering with the external meter 
switch to disconnect the power supply. Such an action could deplete 
the alarm system’s backup batteries, leaving the home vulnerable. 
Triggering an alarm as soon as a disconnection is detected enhances 
overall home security. 
To prevent unnecessary activations, a delay (or tolerance) time of a 
few seconds has been implemented. This helps avoid false alarms 
caused by brief interruptions. In addition to the basic version (see 
Table 1), the digital version o" ers enhanced features: it tracks mains 
voltage drop events, allows adjustment of alarm and delay times, and 
automatically deactivates the signal once the preset alarm duration has 
elapsed. Furthermore, by configuring two DIP switches on the PCB, 
you can enable a beep function and a power-restoration notification. 
These additional features will be discussed in detail later. 
Di! erences Between the Analog and Digital 
Versions 
Analog Version 
As can be seen from the diagram in Figure 1, the power supply section 
has no transformer, which we will find in the digital version instead. 
Therefore, greater care must be taken during testing, since the 
whole circuit is connected to the mains voltage, with danger of 
electrocution in case of contact! In the case of the digital version, 
this danger is limited to the small part of the circuit connected to the 
primary of the transformer, which nevertheless requires a high level 
of attention during the testing phases! 
After the AC rectification and 24 V DC limiting section, consisting of 
diodes D1…D4 diodes and Zener diode D5, we note the split of that 
voltage source into two leads. One heads to the D6-C2 series, the other 
goes to the base of Q1. The D6-C2 series network produces a stabilized

part of the siren or other controlled device of choice. 
In addition to permanent signaling, the Pulse Mode of about 2 s can 
be selected through the other position of switch SW1 (closed contacts 
5-2 and 4-3). In the absence of mains voltage, C3 gradually discharges, 
reducing the voltage across the base of Q1 until it is brought into 
conduction. Q1 thus lets current flow from C2 to the relay, passing 
through C4. The relay is energized, activating the alarm. 
After about half a second, C4 is fully charged, reducing the current 
flow on the relay coil until the relay is de-energized, approximately 2 s 
later. The values of the capacitors and resistors are already calculated 
to make sure that the charge of C2 can sustain the whole cycle. When 
the power returns, Q1 will go o" again, the relay will not change its 
state, and C2 will be charged once more and will be able to support 
new cycles. 
Note the important function of diode D6 in this mode, which acts as 
a “check valve” preventing the base of Q1 from remaining high due to 
the accumulated charge in C2, and the relay from staying o" . 
Digital Version 
The digital version’s greater complexity is immediately apparent from 
the schematic in Figure 2. The circuit is supplied through a trans
former with a 6 V output, which feeds two rectifier bridges, BR1 and 
BR2. The latter, followed by the stabilization section — consisting 
of C3, a small, 5 V linear voltage regulator U1 and C4 at the output 
— provides power for microcontroller U2, a versatile PIC16F1827 by 
Microchip. In the event of no mains voltage, 1.5 F supercapacitor C5 
will continue to provide enough power to the PIC for a considerable 
time. Management of the supercapacitor is achieved by blocking 
diodes D2, D3 and D4, which isolate it during ordinary operation but 
ensure its charge. 
23.3 V output, used to activate the relay via path 4-6 (steady mode) of 
the DPDT switch SW1. When the mains voltage fails, the relay returns 
to the o" position, thus closing the COM-NC contact. Please note: In 
the circuit diagram, the relay is drawn in its de-energized state, which 
means the alarm is on. This is valid only when SW1 is in Steady Mode, 
in the position represented on the schematic. In the other position of 
the switch (4-3/5-2/Pulse Mode) the relay gets energized just for 1 to 
2 seconds (which means then the alarm is on). 
When the mains voltage fails in Steady Mode, the alarm is activated 
with about a 3-to-4-second delay, due to the energy stored by the 
large electrolytic capacitor C2 being discharged. When power comes 
back on, the deactivation of the alarm will occur with about a 2 s delay, 
the time it takes C2 to charge and provide a high enough voltage to 
activate the relay again. 
Capacitor C5, initially discharged, allows the relay to be instanta
neously activated at full voltage, but once charged, the current to 
keep it activated is supplied through R5, and reduced slightly, yet 
remaining at a level more than enough to hold the relay contacts in 
the closed position. This technique greatly extends the life of the relay, 
which remains slightly underpowered most of the time. 
The relay should be a DPDT type, with a 24 V coil and an internal resis
tance of 1,600 Ω. Any mains disconnection that lasts less than the delay 
time mentioned earlier will not produce an alarm activation, since C2 
will not have discharged enough to drop the voltage supplied to the 
relay below its Vo" , measured experimentally at around 4 V. This delay 
avoids unnecessary alarms in case short interruptions might occur. 
In this analog version, the delay time is not adjustable. Another down 
side concerns the alarm time: Once C2 is discharged — and still no 
mains voltage is present at the input — the relay goes o" permanently, 
leaving the alarm active indefinitely. Management of a maximum time

A further reduction in power consumption is made possible by connect
ing the hot side of the two trimmers not directly to the supply voltage, 
but to digital output pin RA2, which will be set to logic high level only 
during the reading of the two trimmers, taken via analog inputs AN3 
and AN4 (pin 2 and 3 of U1, RA3, and RA4, respectively). 
Mains voltage drop detection is done by the section starting at 
BR1, which has no high capacitance downstream, but is equipped 
with a circuit that generates 5.1 V when mains power is present. 
Note jumper JP1, provided for removing and reprogramming of the PIC 
without it being powered by the supercapacitor. To avoid excessive 
voltage drops, diodes D2 and D4 were chosen to be Schottky types, 
with a direct threshold voltage VDS as little as 0.2 V. This allows C5 to 
be charged up to 4.8 V, and to get 4.6 V for the backup power supply 
to the PIC, which has a minimum operating voltage of only 2.8 V for 
the chosen model. 
When the supercapacitor supplies the circuit, the reduction of the 
microcontroller’s power consumption is achieved by software-enabling 
the “Nanowatt” mode, introduced by Microchip on most of its micro
controllers. It sends the controller into a low-power state, where only 
the 32,768 Hz oscillator remains on, reactivating the code execution only 
at the interrupts coming from the timer associated with that oscillator.

The following interrupt() function constitutes the entry-point of 
the PIC’s interrupt service routine, ISR. It is invoked by the interrupt 
generated by Timer1 when the second expires, even in low-power 
mode. An output is provided on the circuit board on test point TP1 
to verify with a frequency meter or oscilloscope the operation of the 
oscillator. 
TP1’s level toggles every second, producing a 0.5 Hz signal. The ground 
for the measurement is available on the respective GND-labeled 
test point. The main purpose of the interrupt procedure is to count 
the elapsed seconds using the 32-bit variable, curs. The interrupt for 
the next cycle is enabled again downstream of the function: 
void interrupt() { 
// Interrupt Service Routine. 
// It is called every second by Timer1 overflow. 
// --------- TMR1 --------- 
// Manage Timer1 overflow (each 1s) 
// to count seconds 
if (PIR1.TMR1IF == 1) { 
CLKOUT ^= 1; // Provide 0.5 Hz to Pin 1 
// for checks 
curs++; // Update the current 
// second counter 
TMR1H = TMR1H_INI; // Reload counter high byte 
TMR1L = TMR1L_INI; // Reload counter low byte 
PIR1.TMR1IF = 0; // Clear TMR1 Interrupt flag 
} 
} 
After hardware setup and initialization of variables, main() function 
handles events according to the logic of a finite-state automaton. 
The current state of the automaton is set in the Mode variable. First, 
pressing on the SW1 button is verified, to reset the event counter and 
for restarting the microcontroller via the reset assembler instruction. 
At the first power-up with a blank microcontroller, and only then, it 
will be necessary to press the SW1 button to set the alarm count in 
EEPROM to zero. At the execution of setup(), following the button 
press, it will also be forced to turn o" the alarm control relay, in case 
(for any reason) it had remained active. 
In the event of an outage, the SENSE-tagged output voltage drops 
quickly, communicating the event to digital input pin RB1 (AN11), which 
interprets a voltage less than 0.8 V as a binary “0”; with the component 
values in this section, this threshold is reached about half a second 
after the mains voltage drop. By mounting optional resistor R3, this 
delay can be further reduced. 
Based on the high or low level of pin RB1, the management software 
activates the alarm, according to the settings of the two potentiome
ters RV1 and RV2, which allow you to adjust the delay time between 
0…10 s, and the alarm time from 0…2 min. 
As mentioned earlier, second-counting is handled by the PIC’s internal 
low-power oscillator, fitted with the small external 32,768 Hz watch 
crystal, X1. Again, to minimize power consumption, the relay chosen 
is a bistable, 3 V, double-coil DPDT type. The two sets of contacts are 
connected in parallel to increase the current carrying capacity, which, 
however, may not exceed 5 A. 
The two turn-on and turn-o" coils are driven by Q1 and Q2 transistors, 
whose bases head to the PIC’s RA6 and RA7 pins. The microcontroller 
will thus be able to turn the relay on and o" with short positive pulses 
on those pins. This chip is also connected to a dual DIP switch, which 
enables the two optional functions, Beep and Back. 
The former limits the alarm on to about one second, to provide a 
brief but intense warning to those in the house, for example, alert
ing them to the voltage drop without disturbing the neighborhood. 
The Back function provides two short pulses to indicate the return 
of mains voltage. However, this function is limited by the maximum 
energy delivery time provided by supercapacitor C5, which is about 
a couple of hours. 
Finally, we note button SW1 and LED D5. The latter has the task of 
using short flashes to indicate the drop events that have occurred. 
If, for example, a power failure has occurred twice, D5 will cycle two 
flashes, followed by a pause of about 3 s. 
To reset the count, simply press the Reset button SW1. This switch 
also performs a full restart of the PIC, and a forced disable of the 
relay, which is useful in case of problems. The two LEDs, D7 and D9, 
indicate the output of the short command to enable and disable the 
relay, which, if not followed by the clicking sound of the relay, help to 
identify a failure of this electromechanical component. 
Software 
Let us focus on the main functions, SetAlm(), interrupt(), and 
main(). The SetAlm function shown below provides for the activa
tion of the alarm device connected to J2 output terminals by direct 
pulses to the bistable relay. The persistence time of the pulse to the 
relay control coils is defined by the constant RlyTim, currently set to 
200 ms. The coils head to pins RA6 and RA7 of the microcontroller, 
which energizes them through Q1 and Q2 transistors. 
January & February 2025 21 
// the MCU is powered just by supercap! 
curs = 0; // Start seconds count 
STSLED = 0; // Force Ststus Led off 
Mode = Mode_TOL; 
// Enter the Tolerance Mode 
} 
break; 
In the Mode_TOL state handled by the following section, one of two 
possible events is awaited: the return of mains voltage before the delay 
time expires, to return again to the Mode_SBY state, or the overrun of 
that time. 
The condition to be met for the latter case is slightly complicated by 
the management of the optional Beep mode activated via the first of 
the two DIP switches. Depending on the state of this switch, either 
the ttol limit time defined first by the RV1 trimmer reading, or the 
MinTol time set by the initial code definitions, corresponding to 2 s, 
will be selected. Exceeding the limit time brings the automaton into 
the Mode_ALM state. 
The continuation of the code is always bound to the Timer1 interrupt, 
since it continues to operate in low-power mode: 
case Mode_TOL: // Waiting ttol time 
// before activating the alarm 
if (POWER == 1) { // Mains is back 
// before the alarm activation 
Mode = Mode_SBY; // Just go 
// back to Standby Mode 
} else { // Check end 
// of Tolerance time 
if ( ((BeepMode==FALSE)&&(curs>=ttol)) 
||((BeepMode==TRUE)&&(curs>=MinTol)) ) { 
SetAlm(); // Start the 
// alarm, 
IncAlm(); // Increment 
// the alarms counter, 
Mode = Mode_ALM; // Enter in 
// the Alarm Mode 
} 
} 
break; 
This part handles the Mode_ALM state. It waits for the mains voltage 
to return, to reset the alarm and return to Standby by permanently 
exiting the low-power mode. Or one waits for the exhalation of the 
maximum alarm time, chosen from the talm value set by the analog 
reading of the RV2 trimmer, or from the MinAlm value preset to 1 s at 
the beginning of the program. It remains in low power in that case, to 
handle the return of the line voltage to the Mode_BACK state: 
case Mode_ALM: // Wait talm seconds before 
Alarm activation events are counted in the AlmCnt variable. Note that 
— in case the return of mains voltage is very late and the capacity 
to support operations provided by supercapacitor C5 is exceeded — 
in order not to lose the alarm count, the value of AlmCnt is saved in 
EEPROM. The setup() function requires it to be read again when the 
microcontroller is restarted: 
void main() { 
setup(); // Initialization 
while(1) { // Forever Loop 
if (Button(&PORTB,4,1,0)){ 
// Reset button pressed 
STSLED = 1; 
Delay_ms(500); 
STSLED = 0; 
AlmCnt = 0; 
EEPROM_Write(CNTADDR, AlmCnt); 
// Raz the Alarms counter in EEPROM 
curms = 0; 
// Raz the elapsed ms for Blink cycle 
BlkSts = 0; // Reset the Blink automaton 
{asm{reset}}; // Reset the MCU 
// (the program will restart) 
} 
In the following excerpt, the voltages on the analog pins connected to 
the slider of the two resistive trimmers are read; they are dedicated to 
adjusting the delay and alarm times. The reading is made possible by 
activating the hot side of the two trimmers via the digital output pin 
RA2, referred to here as DIVPOW. 
Since the microcontroller has a 10-bit A/D converter, the two readings 
will consist of a value between 0 and 1,023, between limits defined by 
configurable parameters that by default limit the delay time to between 
0…10 seconds, and the alarm time to between 0…2 minutes. 
In default state Mode_SBY, managed by the block that follows, the 
automaton waits for the mains voltage drop event, communicated 
by the SENSE line through pin RB1 (AN11) referred to here using the 
POWER definition. If it goes to logic level 0, then second-counting will 
start, setting the PIC to low-power mode. Please keep in mind that 
from then on, power is provided solely by supercapacitor C5. 
The new state is Mode_TOL: 
// Automaton 
switch (Mode) { 
case Mode_SBY: // Nominal Mode. 
// Wait for a Power Down event 
if (POWER == 0) { // The Main power gone down,

January & February 2025 23The 1.5 F supercapacitor is a special component, but nevertheless 
readily available. In this version, the alarm output is provided via a 
three-way terminal, which allows the user to choose NC or NO activa
tion type, depending on the intended use. This is not possible in the 
analog version, due to circuit limitations. 
The digital version thus o" ers greater versatility and ease of use than 
the analog one, thanks to the ability to configure the alarm output 
according to one’s needs. However, the analog version retains a struc
tural simplicity that may be advantageous in some specific applica
tions. The choice between the two versions will therefore depend on 
the user’s needs and the features of the signaling system to which 
the device will be connected.

In Mode_BACK, it waits for the mains voltage to return and signals 
the event by triggering the alarm for two short consecutive pulses if 
provided by the Back DIP switch. Until the grid returns, the PIC is left 
in low-power mode: 
case Mode_BACK: // Waiting for the mains power 
// to come back again 
if (POWER == 1) { // Mains 
// is back: exit to Standby mode 
ResetAlm(); // Force 
// alarm off 
if (BackMode==TRUE) Signal(); 
// Signal "Mains is back" if requested 
Mode = Mode_SBY; 
} 
break; 
After the main automaton, a second four-state automaton was imple
mented just to manage D5 connected to RA0. 
This LED is intended to show the current count of voltage drop events 
of duration longer than the delay time. The AlmCnt counter is reset
table by pressing SW1, managed in the first lines of code of the main 
cycle, seen above. The handling of flashes by an automaton is dictated 
by the need to not interrupt the main cycle with simple delays, which 
would block any other actions during their execution. Flashing times 
are defined by the constants CNTBLINK set to 200 ms, and CNTINTERV, 
which defines the pause between two blocks of flashes, set to 3 s 
(Listing 1). 
Printed Circuit Boards 
For both the analog and digital versions, two single-sided, jumperless 
printed circuit boards have been designed. This will undoubtedly facil
itate their creation using the classic methods of photoengraving, or 
hot transfer. You can download the Gerber files needed for DIY from 
the Elektor Labs page for this article [1]. 
Assembly 
In the analog version shown in the assembly plan, the SW1 switch for 
mode selection is wired to a six-way connector on the printed circuit 
board. You can connect a lever switch to it, or any DPDT switch. The 
digital version of the device, which can be seen in the mounting plan, 
involves socket-mounting the microcontroller, two miniature-type 
trimmers, a two-way dip-switch, and a jumper.

Wind Power: Wise Move or Waste of Time?
The UK Government recently announced the world’s biggest ever expansion in wind energy. So how realistic is this scheme? What are the pitfalls, technical and otherwise, and how viable is it economically? It’s time to look at wind generation in the round.Wind is simply air in motion, with mass and energy. It has been used for centuries, the most obvious example being windmills. In 1850 the American Daniel Halliday developed the ‘multi-bladed’ farm windmill, a relatively simple device that inspired the first attempts to convert wind into a form of energy that could be either stored for future use, or applied elsewhere.

•	Install C and C++ support in Visual 
•	Studio 
•	Article • 12/09/2021 
•	If you haven't downloaded and installed Visual Studio and the Microsoft C/C++ tools 
•	yet, here's how to get started. 
•	Visual Studio 2022 Installation 
•	Welcome to Visual Studio 2022! In this version, it's easy to choose and install just the 
•	features you need. And because of its reduced minimum footprint, it installs quickly and 
•	with less system impact. 
•	７ Note 
•	This topic applies to installation of Visual Studio on Windows. Visual Studio Code 
•	is a lightweight, cross-platform development environment that runs on Windows, 
•	Mac, and Linux systems. The Microsoft C/C++ for Visual Studio Code extension 
•	supports IntelliSense, debugging, code formatting, auto-completion. Visual Studio 
•	for Mac doesn't support Microsoft C++, but does support .NET languages and 
•	cross-platform development. For installation instructions, see Install Visual Studio 
•	for Mac. 
•	Want to know more about what else is new in this version? See the Visual Studio release 
•	notes. 
•	Ready to install? We'll walk you through it, step-by-step. 
•	Step 1 - Make sure your computer is ready for Visual 
•	Studio 
•	Before you begin installing Visual Studio: 
•	1. Check the system requirements. These requirements help you know whether your 
•	computer supports Visual Studio 2022. 
•	2. Apply the latest Windows updates. These updates ensure that your computer has 
•	both the latest security updates and the required system components for Visual 
•	Studio.3. Reboot. The reboot ensures that any pending installs or updates don't hinder the 
•	Visual Studio install. 
•	4. Free up space. Remove unneeded files and applications from your %SystemDrive% 
•	by, for example, running the Disk Cleanup app. 
•	For questions about running previous versions of Visual Studio side by side with Visual 
•	Studio 2022, see the Visual Studio 2022 Platform Targeting and Compatibility page. 
•	Step 2 - Download Visual Studio 
•	Next, download the Visual Studio bootstrapper file. To do so, choose the following 
•	button to go to the Visual Studio download page. Select the edition of Visual Studio that 
•	you want and choose the Free trial or Free download button. 
•	Download Visual Studio 
•	Step 3 - Install the Visual Studio installer 
•	Run the bootstrapper file you downloaded to install the Visual Studio Installer. This new 
•	lightweight installer includes everything you need to both install and customize Visual 
•	Studio. 
•	1. From your Downloads folder, double-click the bootstrapper that matches or is 
•	similar to one of the following files: 
•	vs_community.exe for Visual Studio Community 
•	vs_professional.exe for Visual Studio Professional 
•	vs_enterprise.exe for Visual Studio Enterprise 
•	If you receive a User Account Control notice, choose Yes to allow the bootstrapper 
•	to run. 
•	2. We'll ask you to acknowledge the Microsoft License Terms and the Microsoft 
•	Privacy Statement . Choose Continue. 
•	Step 4 - Choose workloads 
•	After the installer is installed, you can use it to customize your installation by selecting 
•	the workloads, or feature sets, that you want. Here's how. 
•	1. Find the workload you want in the Installing Visual Studio screen.For core C and C++ support, choose the "Desktop development with C++" 
•	workload. It comes with the default core editor, which includes basic code editing 
•	support for over 20 languages, the ability to open and edit code from any folder 
•	without requiring a project, and integrated source code control. 
•	Additional workloads support other kinds of development. For example, choose 
•	the "Universal Windows Platform development" workload to create apps that use 
•	the Windows Runtime for the Microsoft Store. Choose "Game development with 
•	C++" to create games that use DirectX, Unreal, and Cocos2d. Choose "Linux 
•	development with C++" to target Linux platforms, including IoT development. 
•	The Installation details pane lists the included and optional components installed 
•	by each workload. You can select or deselect optional components in this list. For 
•	example, to support development by using the Visual Studio 2017 or 2015 
•	compiler toolsets, choose the MSVC v141 or MSVC v140 optional components. You 
•	can add support for MFC, the experimental Modules language extension, 
•	IncrediBuild, and more. 
•	2. After you choose the workload(s) and optional components you want, choose 
•	Install. 
•	Next, status screens appear that show the progress of your Visual Studio 
•	installation. 
•	 Tip 
•	At any time after installation, you can install workloads or components that you 
•	didn't install initially. If you have Visual Studio open, go to Tools > Get Tools andFeatures... which opens the Visual Studio Installer. Or, open Visual Studio Installer 
•	from the Start menu. From there, you can choose the workloads or components 
•	that you wish to install. Then, choose Modify. 
•	Step 5 - Choose individual components (Optional) 
•	If you don't want to use the Workloads feature to customize your Visual Studio 
•	installation, or you want to add more components than a workload installs, you can do 
•	so by installing or adding individual components from the Individual components tab. 
•	Choose what you want, and then follow the prompts. 
•	Step 6 - Install language packs (Optional) 
•	By default, the installer program tries to match the language of the operating system 
•	when it runs for the first time. To install Visual Studio in a language of your choosing, 
•	choose the Language packs tab from the Visual Studio Installer, and then follow the 
•	prompts. 
•	Change the installer language from the command line 
•	Another way that you can change the default language is by running the installer from 
•	the command line. For example, you can force the installer to run in English by using the 
•	following command: vs_installer.exe --locale en-US . The installer will remember this 
•	setting when it's run the next time. The installer supports the following language tokens: 
•	zh-cn, zh-tw, cs-cz, en-us, es-es, fr-fr, de-de, it-it, ja-jp, ko-kr, pl-pl, pt-br, ru-ru, and tr-tr.Step 7 - Change the installation location (Optional) 
•	You can reduce the installation footprint of Visual Studio on your system drive. You can 
•	choose to move the download cache, shared components, SDKs, and tools to different 
•	drives, and keep Visual Studio on the drive that runs it the fastest. 
•	） Important 
•	You can select a different drive only when you first install Visual Studio. If you've 
•	already installed it and want to change drives, you must uninstall Visual Studio and 
•	then reinstall it. 
•	Step 8 - Start developing 
•	1. After Visual Studio installation is complete, choose the Launch button to get 
•	started developing with Visual Studio. 
•	2. On the start window, choose Create a new project. 
•	3. In the search box, enter the type of app you want to create to see a list of available 
•	templates. The list of templates depends on the workload(s) that you chose during 
•	installation. To see different templates, choose different workloads. 
•	You can also filter your search for a specific programming language by using the 
•	Language drop-down list. You can filter by using the Platform list and the Project 
•	type list, too. 
•	4. Visual Studio opens your new project, and you're ready to code! 
•	When Visual Studio is running, you're ready to continue to the next step.

•	The usual starting point for a C++ programmer is a "Hello, world!" application that runs 
•	on the command line. That's what you create in Visual Studio in this step. 
•	Prerequisites 
•	Have Visual Studio with the Desktop development with C++ workload installed 
•	and running on your computer. If it's not installed yet, see Install C++ support in 
•	Visual Studio. 
•	Create your app project 
•	Visual Studio uses projects to organize the code for an app, and solutions to organize 
•	your projects. A project contains all the options, configurations, and rules used to build 
•	your apps. It manages the relationship between all the project's files and any external 
•	files. To create your app, first, create a new project and solution. 
•	1. In Visual Studio, open the File menu and choose New > Project to open the Create 
•	a new Project dialog. Select the Console App template that has C++, Windows, 
•	and Console tags, and then choose Next.2. In the Configure your new project dialog, enter HelloWorld in the Project name 
•	edit box. Choose Create to create the project. 
•	Visual Studio creates a new project. It's ready for you to add and edit your source 
•	code. By default, the Console App template provides source code for a "Hello 
•	World" app, like this:

•	and build your app.I ran into a problem. 
•	Next steps 
•	Build and run a C++ project 
•	Troubleshooting guide 
•	Come here for solutions to common issues when you create your first C++ project. 
•	Create your app project: issues 
•	The New Project dialog should show a Console App template that has C++, Windows, 
•	and Console tags. If you don't see it, there are two possible causes. It might be filtered 
•	out of the list, or it might not be installed. First, check the filter dropdowns at the top of 
•	the list of templates. Set them to C++, Windows, and Console. The C++ Console App 
•	template should appear; otherwise, the Desktop development with C++ workload isn't 
•	installed. 
•	To install Desktop development with C++, you can run the installer right from the New 
•	Project dialog. Choose the Install more tools and features link at the bottom of the 
•	template list to start the installer. If the User Account Control dialog requests 
•	permissions, choose Yes. In the installer, make sure the Desktop development with C++ 
•	workload is checked. Then choose Modify to update your Visual Studio installation. 
•	If another project with the same name already exists, choose another name for your 
•	project. Or, delete the existing project and try again. To delete an existing project, delete 
•	the solution folder (the folder that contains the helloworld.sln file) in File Explorer.

•	Article • 07/01/2024 
•	In Create a C++ console app project you created a C++ console app project and 
•	entered your code. Now you can build and run it within Visual Studio. Then, run it as a 
•	stand-alone app from the command line. 
•	Prerequisites 
•	Have Visual Studio with the Desktop development with C++ workload installed 
•	and running on your computer. If it's not installed, follow the steps in Install C++ 
•	support in Visual Studio. 
•	Create a "Hello, World!" project. By default, it contains code to print Hello World! . 
•	If you haven't done this step yet, follow the steps in Create a C++ console app 
•	project. 
•	If Visual Studio looks like this, you're ready to build and run your app: 
•	Build and run your code in Visual Studio1. To build your project, from the main menu choose Build > Build Solution. The 
•	Output window shows the results of the build process. 
•	2. To run the code, on the menu bar, choose Debug, Start without debugging. 
•	A console window opens and then runs your app. When you start a console app in 
•	Visual Studio, it runs your code, then prints "Press any key to continue . . ." to give 
•	you a chance to see the output.Congratulations! You created your first "Hello, world!" console app in Visual Studio! 
•	Press a key to dismiss the console window and return to Visual Studio. 
•	I ran into a problem. 
•	Run your code in a command window 
•	Normally, you run console apps at the command prompt, not in Visual Studio. Once 
•	Visual Studio builds your app, you can run it from a command window. Here's how to 
•	find and run your new app in a command prompt window. 
•	1. In Solution Explorer, select the HelloWorld solution (not the HelloWorld project) 
•	and right-click to open the context menu. Choose Open Folder in File Explorer to 
•	open a File Explorer window in the HelloWorld solution folder. 
•	2. In the File Explorer window, open the x64 folder and then the Debug folder. This 
•	folder contains your app, HelloWorld.exe , and debugging files. Hold down the 
•	Shift key and right-click on HelloWorld.exe to open the context menu. Choose 
•	Copy as path to copy the path to your app to the clipboard. If you see 
•	HelloWorld.exe.recipe , it's because you did the Open Folder in File Explorer step 
•	on the HelloWorld project instead of the HelloWorld solution. Navigate up a level in 
•	File Explorer to get to the solution folder. This folder also contains a x64\Debug\ 
•	folder, where HelloWorld.exe is. 
•	3. To open a command prompt window, press Windows+R to open the Run dialog. 
•	Enter cmd.exe in the Open textbox, then choose OK to run a command prompt 
•	window. 
•	4. In the command prompt window, right-click to paste the path to your app into the

•	You can also navigate to the solution x64\Debug folder at the command line to run your 
•	app. Your app won't run from other directories without specifying the path to the app. 
•	However, you can copy your app to another directory and run it from there. It's also 
•	possible to copy it to a directory specified by your PATH environment variable, then run 
•	it from anywhere. 
•	If you don't see Copy as path in the shortcut menu, dismiss the menu, and then hold

•	Article • 11/07/2022 
•	Since its creation, C++ has become one of the most widely used programming 
•	languages in the world. Well-written C++ programs are fast and efficient. The language 
•	is more flexible than other languages: It can work at the highest levels of abstraction, 
•	and down at the level of the silicon. C++ supplies highly optimized standard libraries. It 
•	enables access to low-level hardware features, to maximize speed and minimize memory 
•	requirements. C++ can create almost any kind of program: Games, device drivers, HPC, 
•	cloud, desktop, embedded, and mobile apps, and much more. Even libraries and 
•	compilers for other programming languages get written in C++. 
•	One of the original requirements for C++ was backward compatibility with the C 
•	language. As a result, C++ has always permitted C-style programming, with raw 
•	pointers, arrays, null-terminated character strings, and other features. They may enable 
•	great performance, but can also spawn bugs and complexity. The evolution of C++ has 
•	emphasized features that greatly reduce the need to use C-style idioms. The old C 
•	programming facilities are still there when you need them. However, in modern C++ 
•	code you should need them less and less. Modern C++ code is simpler, safer, more 
•	elegant, and still as fast as ever. 
•	The following sections provide an overview of the main features of modern C++. Unless 
•	noted otherwise, the features listed here are available in C++11 and later. In the 
•	Microsoft C++ compiler, you can set the /std compiler option to specify which version 
•	of the standard to use for your project. 
•	Resources and smart pointers 
•	One of the major classes of bugs in C-style programming is the memory leak. Leaks are 
•	often caused by a failure to call delete for memory that was allocated with new . 
•	Modern C++ emphasizes the principle of resource acquisition is initialization (RAII). The 
•	idea is simple. Resources (heap memory, file handles, sockets, and so on) should be 
•	owned by an object. That object creates, or receives, the newly allocated resource in its 
•	constructor, and deletes it in its destructor. The principle of RAII guarantees that all 
•	resources get properly returned to the operating system when the owning object goes 
•	out of scope. 
•	To support easy adoption of RAII principles, the C++ Standard Library provides three 
•	smart pointer types: std::unique_ptr, std::shared_ptr, and std::weak_ptr. A smart pointer 
•	handles the allocation and deletion of the memory it owns. The following exampleshows a class with an array member that is allocated on the heap in the call to 
•	make_unique() . The calls to new and delete are encapsulated by the unique_ptr class. 
•	When a widget object goes out of scope, the unique_ptr destructor will be invoked and 
•	it will release the memory that was allocated for the array. 
•	C++ 
•	Whenever possible, use a smart pointer to manage heap memory. If you must use the 
•	new and delete operators explicitly, follow the principle of RAII. For more information, 
•	see Object lifetime and resource management (RAII). 
•	C-style strings are another major source of bugs. By using std::string and std::wstring, 
•	you can eliminate virtually all the errors associated with C-style strings. You also gain the 
•	benefit of member functions for searching, appending, prepending, and so on. Both are 
•	highly optimized for speed. When passing a string to a function that requires only read 
•	only access, in C++17 you can use std::string_view for even greater performance benefit. 
•	The standard library containers all follow the principle of RAII. They provide iterators for 
•	safe traversal of elements. And, they're highly optimized for performance and have been 
•	thoroughly tested for correctness. By using these containers, you eliminate the potential 
•	#include <memory> 
•	class widget 
•	{ 
•	private: 
•	std::unique_ptr<int[]> data; 
•	public: 
•	widget(const int size) { data = std::make_unique<int[]>(size); } 
•	void do_something() {} 
•	}; 
•	void functionUsingWidget() { 
•	widget w(1000000); // lifetime automatically tied to enclosing scope 
•	// constructs w, including the w.data gadget member 
•	// ... 
•	w.do_something(); 
•	// ... 
•	} // automatic destruction and deallocation for w and w.data 
•	std::string and std::string_view 
•	std::vector and other Standard Library 
•	containersfor bugs or inefficiencies that might be introduced in custom data structures. Instead of 
•	raw arrays, use vector as a sequential container in C++. 
•	C++ 
•	vector<string> apples; 
•	apples.push_back("Granny Smith"); 
•	Use map (not unordered_map ) as the default associative container. Use set, multimap, 
•	and multiset for degenerate and multi cases. 
•	C++ 
•	map<string, string> apple_color; 
•	// ... 
•	apple_color["Granny Smith"] = "Green"; 
•	When performance optimization is needed, consider using: 
•	Unordered associative containers such as unordered_map. These have lower per 
•	element overhead and constant-time lookup, but they can be harder to use 
•	correctly and efficiently. 
•	Sorted vector . For more information, see Algorithms. 
•	Don't use C-style arrays. For older APIs that need direct access to the data, use accessor 
•	methods such as f(vec.data(), vec.size()); instead. For more information about 
•	containers, see C++ Standard Library Containers. 
•	Standard Library algorithms 
•	Before you assume that you need to write a custom algorithm for your program, first 
•	review the C++ Standard Library algorithms. The Standard Library contains an ever 
•	growing assortment of algorithms for many common operations such as searching, 
•	sorting, filtering, and randomizing. The math library is extensive. In C++17 and later, 
•	parallel versions of many algorithms are provided. 
•	Here are some important examples: 
•	for_each , the default traversal algorithm (along with range-based for loops). 
•	transform , for not-in-place modification of container elements 
•	find_if , the default search algorithm. 
•	sort , lower_bound , and the other default sorting and searching algorithms.To write a comparator, use strict < and use named lambdas when you can. 
•	C++ 
•	C++11 introduced the auto keyword for use in variable, function, and template 
•	declarations. auto tells the compiler to deduce the type of the object so that you don't 
•	have to type it explicitly. auto is especially useful when the deduced type is a nested 
•	template: 
•	C++ 
•	C-style iteration over arrays and containers is prone to indexing errors and is also 
•	tedious to type. To eliminate these errors, and make your code more readable, use 
•	range-based for loops with both Standard Library containers and raw arrays. For more 
•	information, see Range-based for statement. 
•	C++ 
•	auto comp = [](const widget& w1, const widget& w2) 
•	{ return w1.weight() < w2.weight(); } 
•	sort( v.begin(), v.end(), comp ); 
•	auto i = lower_bound( v.begin(), v.end(), widget{0}, comp ); 
•	auto instead of explicit type names 
•	map<int,list<string>>::iterator i = m.begin(); // C-style 
•	auto i = m.begin(); // modern C++ 
•	Range-based for loops 
•	#include <iostream> 
•	#include <vector> 
•	int main() 
•	{ 
•	std::vector<int> v {1,2,3}; 
•	// C-style 
•	for(int i = 0; i < v.size(); ++i) 
•	{ 
•	std::cout << v[i]; 
•	}Macros in C and C++ are tokens that are processed by the preprocessor before 
•	compilation. Each instance of a macro token is replaced with its defined value or 
•	expression before the file is compiled. Macros are commonly used in C-style 
•	programming to define compile-time constant values. However, macros are error-prone 
•	and difficult to debug. In modern C++, you should prefer constexpr variables for 
•	compile-time constants: 
•	C++ 
•	In modern C++, you can use brace initialization for any type. This form of initialization is 
•	especially convenient when initializing arrays, vectors, or other containers. In the 
•	following example, v2 is initialized with three instances of S . v3 is initialized with three 
•	instances of S that are themselves initialized using braces. The compiler infers the type 
•	of each element based on the declared type of v3 . 
•	C++ 
•	// Modern C++: 
•	for(auto& num : v) 
•	{ 
•	std::cout << num; 
•	} 
•	} 
•	constexpr expressions instead of macros 
•	#define SIZE 10 // C-style 
•	constexpr int size = 10; // modern C++ 
•	Uniform initialization 
•	#include <vector> 
•	struct S 
•	{ 
•	std::string name; 
•	float num; 
•	S(std::string s, float f) : name(s), num(f) {} 
•	}; 
•	int main() 
•	{ 
•	// C-style initialization 
•	std::vector<S> v; 
•	S s1("Norah", 2.7);For more information, see Brace initialization. 
•	Modern C++ provides move semantics, which make it possible to eliminate unnecessary 
•	memory copies. In earlier versions of the language, copies were unavoidable in certain 
•	situations. A move operation transfers ownership of a resource from one object to the 
•	next without making a copy. Some classes own resources such as heap memory, file 
•	handles, and so on. When you implement a resource-owning class, you can define a 
•	move constructor and move assignment operator for it. The compiler chooses these 
•	special members during overload resolution in situations where a copy isn't needed. The 
•	Standard Library container types invoke the move constructor on objects if one is 
•	defined. For more information, see Move Constructors and Move Assignment Operators 
•	(C++). 
•	In C-style programming, a function can be passed to another function by using a 
•	function pointer. Function pointers are inconvenient to maintain and understand. The 
•	function they refer to may be defined elsewhere in the source code, far away from the 
•	point at which it's invoked. Also, they're not type-safe. Modern C++ provides function 
•	objects, classes that override the operator() operator, which enables them to be called 
•	like a function. The most convenient way to create function objects is with inline lambda 
•	expressions. The following example shows how to use a lambda expression to pass a 
•	function object, that the find_if function will invoke on each element in the vector: 
•	C++ 
•	S s2("Frank", 3.5); 
•	S s3("Jeri", 85.9); 
•	v.push_back(s1); 
•	v.push_back(s2); 
•	v.push_back(s3); 
•	// Modern C++: 
•	std::vector<S> v2 {s1, s2, s3}; 
•	// or... 
•	std::vector<S> v3{ {"Norah", 2.7}, {"Frank", 3.5}, {"Jeri", 85.9} }; 
•	} 
•	Move semantics 
•	Lambda expressionsThe lambda expression [=](int i) { return i > x && i < y; } can be read as "function 
•	that takes a single argument of type int and returns a boolean that indicates whether 
•	the argument is greater than x and less than y ." Notice that the variables x and y 
•	from the surrounding context can be used in the lambda. The [=] specifies that those 
•	variables are captured by value; in other words, the lambda expression has its own 
•	copies of those values. 
•	Modern C++ emphasizes exceptions, not error codes, as the best way to report and 
•	handle error conditions. For more information, see Modern C++ best practices for 
•	exceptions and error handling. 
•	Use the C++ Standard Library std::atomic struct and related types for inter-thread 
•	communication mechanisms. 
•	Unions are commonly used in C-style programming to conserve memory by enabling 
•	members of different types to occupy the same memory location. However, unions 
•	aren't type-safe and are prone to programming errors. C++17 introduces the 
•	std::variant class as a more robust and safe alternative to unions. The std::visit function 
•	can be used to access the members of a variant type in a type-safe manner.

•	Article • 10/08/2024 
•	The usual starting point for a C++ programmer is a "Hello, world!" application that runs 
•	on the command line. You start with that in this article, and then move on to something 
•	more challenging: a calculator app. 
•	Prerequisites 
•	Visual Studio with the Desktop development with C++ workload installed and 
•	running on your computer. To install it, see Install C++ support in Visual Studio. 
•	This tutorial demonstrates a feature called edit and continue which allows you to 
•	make changes to your code while the app is running. To enable edit and continue, 
•	from the main menu select Tools > Options > Debugging > General and ensure 
•	that Require source files to exactly match the original version is checked. 
•	Create your app project 
•	Visual Studio uses projects to organize the code for an app, and solutions to organize 
•	one or more projects. A project contains all the options, configurations, and rules used 
•	to build an app. It also manages the relationship between all the project's files and any 
•	external files. To create your app, first, create a new project and solution. 
•	1. Start Visual Studio--the Visual Studio Start dialog box appears. Select Create a new 
•	project to get started.2. In the Create a new project dialog, set the language dropdown to C++, set the 
•	platform dropdown to Windows, select Console App from the list of project types, 
•	then select Next. 
•	） Important 
•	Make sure you select the C++ version of the Console App template. It has the 
•	C++, Windows, and Console tags, and the icon has "++" in the corner.3. In the Configure your new project dialog box, select the Project name text box, 
•	name your new project CalculatorTutorial, then select Create. 
•	An empty C++ Windows console application 'Hello World' app is created. Console 
•	applications use a Windows console window to display output and accept user 
•	input. In Visual Studio, an editor window opens and shows the generated code: 
•	C++ 
•	// CalculatorTutorial.cpp : This file contains the 'main' function. 
•	Program execution begins and ends there. 
•	// 
•	#include <iostream> 
•	int main() 
•	{ 
•	std::cout << "Hello World!\n"; 
•	} 
•	// Run program: Ctrl + F5 or Debug > Start Without Debugging menu 
•	// Debug program: F5 or Debug > Start Debugging menu 
•	// Tips for Getting Started: 
•	// 1. Use the Solution Explorer window to add/manage files 
•	// 2. Use the Team Explorer window to connect to source control 
•	// 3. Use the Output window to see build output and other messages 
•	// 4. Use the Error List window to view errors 
•	// 5. Go to Project > Add New Item to create new code files, or 
•	Project > Add Existing Item to add existing code files to the project// 6. In the future, to open this project again, go to File > Open > 
•	Project and select the .sln file 
•	Verify that your new app builds and runs 
•	The template for a new Windows console application creates a simple C++ "Hello 
•	World" app. At this point, you can see how Visual Studio builds and runs the apps you 
•	create right from the IDE. 
•	1. To build your project, select Build Solution from the Build menu. The Output 
•	window shows the results of the build process. 
•	2. To run the code, on the menu bar, select Debug > Start without debugging 
•	(Ctrl+F5).A console window opens and your app runs within it. 
•	When you start a console app in Visual Studio, it runs your code, then prints "Press 
•	any key to close this window . . ." to give you a chance to see the output. 
•	Congratulations! You created your first "Hello, world!" console app in Visual Studio! 
•	3. Press a key to dismiss the console window and return to Visual Studio. 
•	You now have the tools to build and run your app after every change, to verify that the 
•	code still works as you expect. Later, we show you how to debug it if it doesn't. 
•	Now let's modify the code in this template to be a calculator app. 
•	1. Replace the contents of the CalculatorTutorial.cpp file with the following code so 
•	that it matches this example: 
•	C++ 
•	Edit the code 
•	// CalculatorTutorial.cpp : This file contains the 'main' function. 
•	Program execution begins and ends there. 
•	// 
•	#include <iostream> 
•	using namespace std; 
•	int main() 
•	{ 
•	cout << "Calculator Console Application" << endl << endl; 
•	cout << "Please enter the operation to perform. Format: a+b | a-b |Understanding the code: 
•	The #include statement brings in code in other files. Sometimes, you 
•	may see a filename surrounded by angle brackets like <iostream> . The 
•	angle brackets instruct the compiler to look for the iostream header file 
•	first in the standard system directories, and if not found, to look in 
•	directories specific to the project. Other times, you may see a filename 
•	surrounded by quotes like "someHeader.h" . The quotes instruct the 
•	compiler to skip looking in the standard system directories and instead 
•	only look in directories specific to the project. 
•	The using namespace std; tells the compiler to expect code from the 
•	C++ Standard Library to be used in this file. Without this line, each 
•	keyword from the library would have to be preceded with std:: to 
•	denote its scope. For instance, without that line, each reference to cout 
•	would be written as std::cout . The using statement is added to make it 
•	more convenient to access code in another namespace. 
•	The cout keyword is used to print to standard output in C++. The << 
•	operator tells the compiler to send whatever is to the right of it to the 
•	standard output. 
•	The endl keyword is like the Enter key; it ends the line and moves the 
•	cursor to the next line. It's a better practice to put a \n inside the string 
•	(contained by "" ) to do the same thing because endl always flushes the 
•	buffer which can hurt the performance of the program. But since this is a 
•	very small app, endl is used instead. 
•	All C++ statements must end with semicolons and all C++ applications 
•	must contain a main() function. This function is what the program runs at 
•	a*b | a/b" 
•	<< endl; 
•	return 0; 
•	} 
•	// Run program: Ctrl + F5 or Debug > Start Without Debugging menu 
•	// Debug program: F5 or Debug > Start Debugging menu 
•	// Tips for Getting Started: 
•	// 1. Use the Solution Explorer window to add/manage files 
•	// 2. Use the Team Explorer window to connect to source control 
•	// 3. Use the Output window to see build output and other messages 
•	// 4. Use the Error List window to view errors 
•	// 5. Go to Project > Add New Item to create new code files, or 
•	Project > Add Existing Item to add existing code files to the project 
•	// 6. In the future, to open this project again, go to File > Open > 
•	Project and select the .sln filethe start. All code must be accessible from main() in order to be used. 
•	2. To save the file, press Ctrl+S, or select the floppy disk icon in the toolbar under the 
•	menu bar. 
•	3. To run the application, press Ctrl+F5 or go to the Debug menu and select Start 
•	Without Debugging. You should see a console window appear that looks like this. 
•	4. Close the console window when you're done. 
•	Add code to do some math 
•	A class is like a blueprint for an object that does something. In this case, we define a 
•	calculator class to contain the math logic. 
•	Add a Calculator class 
•	1. Go to the Project menu and select Add Class. In the Class Name edit box, enter 
•	Calculator. Select OK. 
•	Two new files get added to your project. To save all your changed files at once, 
•	press Ctrl+Shift+S. It's a keyboard shortcut for File > Save All. There's also a 
•	toolbar button for Save All, an icon of two floppy disks, found beside the Savebutton. In general, it's good practice to do Save All frequently, so you don't miss 
•	saving any changes. 
•	The Add Class wizard creates .h and .cpp files that have the same name as the 
•	class. You can see a full list of your project files in the Solution Explorer window, 
•	visible on the side of the IDE. If the window isn't visible, open it from the menu bar 
•	via View > Solution Explorer. 
•	You can open a file by double-clicking it in the Solution Explorer window. Double 
•	click Calculator.h to open it. 
•	2. Replace the contents of Calculator.h with the following code so that the file now 
•	looks like this: 
•	C++ 
•	Understanding the code 
•	This code declares a new function called Calculate , which handles math 
•	operations for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. 
•	#pragma once 
•	class Calculator 
•	{ 
•	public: 
•	double Calculate(double x, char oper, double y); 
•	};C++ code is organized into header ( .h ) files and source ( .cpp ) files. 
•	Some other file extensions are supported by various compilers, but these 
•	are the main ones to know about. Functions and variables are normally 
•	declared, that is, given a name and a type, in header files, and 
•	implemented, or given a definition, in source files. To access code defined 
•	in another file, you can use #include "filename.h" , where filename.h is 
•	the name of the file that declares the variables or functions you want to 
•	use. 
•	It's good practice to organize your code into different files based on what 
•	it does, so it's easy to find the code you need later. In our case, we define 
•	the Calculator class separately from the file containing the main() 
•	function, but we plan to reference the Calculator class in main() . 
•	3. A green squiggle appears under Calculate because although the Calculate 
•	function is declared, it isn't defined. Hover over Calculate , click the down arrow on 
•	the screwdriver icon, and select Create definition of 'Calculate' in Calculator.cpp . 
•	This code is added to Calculator.cpp :Currently, it just returns 0.0. Let's change that. 
•	4. Switch to the Calculator.cpp file in the editor window. Replace the contents of 
•	Calculator::Calculate(double x, char oper, double y) with: 
•	C++ 
•	Understanding the code 
•	The function Calculate takes a number, an operator, and a second 
•	number. Then it performs the requested operation on the two numbers. 
•	The switch statement checks which operator was provided, and executes 
•	the case corresponding to that operation. The default: case is a fallback 
•	double Calculator::Calculate(double x, char oper, double y) 
•	{ 
•	switch(oper) 
•	{ 
•	case '+': 
•	return x + y; 
•	case '-': 
•	return x - y; 
•	case '*': 
•	return x * y; 
•	case '/': 
•	return x / y; 
•	default: 
•	return 0.0; 
•	} 
•	}in case the user types an operator that isn't handled by any of the 
•	preceding case statements. It's best to handle invalid user input in a 
•	more elegant way, but this is beyond the scope of this tutorial. 
•	The double keyword denotes a type of number that supports decimals. 
•	This type of number is called a floating-point number, and double means 
•	a floating point number that has extra precision. This way, the calculator 
•	can handle both decimal math and integer math. The Calculate function 
•	is required to always return a double-precision floating point number due 
•	to the double at the start of the code (this denotes the function's return 
•	type), which is why we return 0.0 in the default case. 
•	The .h file declares the function prototype, which tells the compiler 
•	upfront what parameters it requires, and what return type to expect from 
•	it. The .cpp file has all the implementation details of the function. 
•	If you build and run the code again at this point, it immediately exits after asking which 
•	operation to perform. So, modify the main function to do multiple calculations. 
•	1. Update the main function in CalculatorTutorial.cpp as follows: 
•	C++ 
•	Call the Calculator class member functions 
•	// CalculatorTutorial.cpp : This file contains the 'main' function. 
•	Program execution begins and ends there. 
•	// 
•	#include <iostream> 
•	#include "Calculator.h" 
•	using namespace std; 
•	int main() 
•	{ 
•	double x = 0.0; 
•	double y = 0.0; 
•	double result = 0.0; 
•	char oper = '+'; 
•	cout << "Calculator Console Application" << endl << endl; 
•	cout << "Please enter the operation to perform. Format: a+b | a-b | 
•	a*b | a/b" 
•	<< endl; 
•	Calculator c; 
•	while (true) 
•	{Understanding the code 
•	Since C++ programs always start at the main() function, we need to call 
•	our other code from there, so an #include statement is needed to make 
•	that code visible to our main() function. 
•	The variables x , y , oper , and result are declared to store the first 
•	number, second number, operator, and final result, respectively. It's 
•	always good practice to give them some initial values to avoid undefined 
•	behavior, which is what is done here. 
•	The Calculator c; line declares an object named c as an instance of the 
•	Calculator class. The class itself is just a blueprint for how calculators 
•	work; the object is the specific calculator that does the math. 
•	The while (true) statement is a loop. The code inside the loop executes 
•	over and over again as long as the condition inside the () holds true. 
•	Since the condition is simply listed as true , it's always true, so the loop 
•	runs forever. To close the program, the user must manually close the 
•	console window. Otherwise, the program always waits for new input. 
•	The cin keyword accepts input from the user. The input stream is smart 
•	enough to process a line of text entered in the console window and place 
•	it inside each of the variables listed, in order. 
•	The c.Calculate(x, oper, y); expression calls the Calculate function 
•	defined earlier, and supplies the entered input values and the requested 
•	operation. The function then returns a number that is stored in result . 
•	Finally, result is printed to the console and the user sees the result of 
•	the calculation. 
•	Now test the program again to make sure everything works properly. 
•	1. Press Ctrl+F5 to rebuild and start the app. 
•	2. Enter 5+5 , and press Enter. Verify that the result is 10. 
•	cin >> x >> oper >> y; 
•	result = c.Calculate(x, oper, y); 
•	cout << "Result " << "of " << x << oper << y << " is: " << 
•	result << endl; 
•	} 
•	return 0; 
•	} 
•	Build and test the code again3. Stop the program by closing the console window. 
•	Debug the app 
•	Since the user is free to type anything into the console window, let's make sure the 
•	calculator handles unexpected input. Instead of running the program, let's debug it so 
•	we can inspect what it's doing step-by-step. 
•	Run the app in the debugger 
•	1. In CalcuatorTutorial.cpp , set a breakpoint on the line: result = c.Calculate(x, 
•	oper, y); . To set the breakpoint, click next to the line in the gray vertical bar along 
•	the left edge of the editor window so that a red dot appears. 
•	Now when we debug the program, execution pauses at that line. We already have 
•	a rough idea that the program works for simple cases. Since we don't want to 
•	pause execution every time we call Calculate() , let's make the breakpoint 
•	conditional.2. Right-click the red dot that represents the breakpoint, and select Conditions. In 
•	the edit box for the condition, enter (y == 0) && (oper == '/') . Select the Close 
•	button to save the breakpoint condition. 
•	Now, execution pauses at the breakpoint when the app tries to divide by 0. 
•	3. To debug the program, press F5, or select the Local Windows Debugger debugger 
•	toolbar button that has the green arrow icon. In your console app, if you enter 
•	something like "5 - 0", the program behaves normally and keeps running. 
•	However, if you type "10 / 0", it pauses at the breakpoint. You can put any number 
•	of spaces between the operator and numbers: cin is smart enough to parse the 
•	input appropriately.Useful windows in the debugger 
•	When you debug your code, you may notice that some new windows appear. These 
•	windows can assist your debugging experience. Take a look at the Autos window. The 
•	Autos window shows you the current values of variables used at least three lines before 
•	and up to the current line. If you don't see the Autos window, from the main menu 
•	select Debug > Windows > Autos. 
•	To see all of the variables from that function, switch to the Locals window. Because this 
•	is a small function, the Autos and Locals window show the same variables. But you can 
•	modify the values of these variables in the Locals window while debugging to see what 
•	effect they would have on the program. In this case, we leave them alone. Open the 
•	Locals window by selecting Locals at the bottom of the Autos window, or by selecting 
•	from the main menu Debug > Windows > Locals.You can also hover over variables in the code to see their current values at the point 
•	where execution is currently paused. Make sure the editor window is in focus by clicking 
•	on it first. 
•	Continue debugging 
•	1. The yellow arrow on the left shows the current point of execution. The current line 
•	calls Calculate , so press F11 to Step Into the function. Now you're executing code 
•	in the body of the Calculate function. Be careful with Step Into because it steps 
•	into any functions on the line you're on, including standard library functions. It's 
•	fine to step into the standard library, but you may be more interested in focusing 
•	on your code instead of library code. 
•	2. Now that the point of execution is at the start of the Calculate function, press F10 
•	to move to the next line in the program's execution. F10 is also known as Step 
•	Over. You can use Step Over to move from line to line, without delving into the 
•	details of what is occurring in each part of the line. In general, you should use Step 
•	Over instead of Step Into unless you want to dive more deeply into code that is 
•	being called from elsewhere (as you did to reach the body of Calculate ). 
•	3. Continue using F10 to Step Over each line until you get back to the main() 
•	function in the other file, and stop on the cout line.The program is doing what's expected: it takes the first number, and divides it by 
•	the second. On the cout line, hover over the result variable or take a look at 
•	result in the Autos window. Its value is inf , which doesn't look right. 
•	Let's fix it. The cout line outputs whatever value is stored in result , so when you 
•	step one more line forward using F10, the console window displays: 
•	This result is because division by zero is undefined, so the program doesn't have a 
•	numerical answer for the requested operation. 
•	Fix the "divide by zero" error 
•	Let's handle division by zero more gracefully so that it's easier for the user to 
•	understand the problem. 
•	1. Make the following changes in CalculatorTutorial.cpp . You can leave the 
•	program running as you edit, thanks to a debugger feature called Edit andContinue. Add an if statement following cin >> x >> oper >> y; to check for 
•	division by zero and output a message to the user if it happens. Otherwise, the 
•	result is printed. 
•	C++ 
•	2. Press F5 once. Program execution continues until it has to pause to ask for user 
•	input. Enter 10 / 0 again. Now, a more helpful message is printed. The user is 
•	asked for more input, and the program continues executing normally. 
•	// CalculatorTutorial.cpp : This file contains the 'main' function. 
•	Program execution begins and ends there. 
•	// 
•	#include <iostream> 
•	#include "Calculator.h" 
•	using namespace std; 
•	int main() 
•	{ 
•	double x = 0.0; 
•	double y = 0.0; 
•	double result = 0.0; 
•	char oper = '+'; 
•	cout << "Calculator Console Application" << endl << endl; 
•	cout << "Please enter the operation to perform. Format: a+b | a-b | 
•	a*b | a/b" << endl; 
•	Calculator c; 
•	while (true) 
•	{ 
•	cin >> x >> oper >> y; 
•	if (oper == '/' && y == 0) 
•	{ 
•	cout << "Math error: Attempted to divide by zero!" << endl; 
•	continue; 
•	} 
•	else 
•	{ 
•	result = c.Calculate(x, oper, y); 
•	} 
•	cout << "Result " << "of " << x << oper << y << " is: " << 
•	result << endl; 
•	} 
•	return 0; 
•	}７ Note 
•	When you edit code while in debugging mode, there's a risk of code 
•	becoming stale. This happens when the debugger is still running your old 
•	code, and has not yet updated it with your changes. The debugger displays a 
•	dialog to inform you when this happens. Sometimes, you may need to press 
•	F5 to refresh the code being executed. In particular, if you make a change 
•	inside a function while the point of execution is inside that function, you need 
•	to step out of the function, then back into it again to get the updated code. If 
•	that doesn't work and you see an error message, you can stop debugging by 
•	clicking on the red square in the toolbar under the menus at the top of the 
•	IDE, then start debugging again by entering F5 or by choosing the green 
•	"play" arrow beside the stop button on the toolbar. 
•	Another reason edit and continue may fail is if you see a message that says 
•	"The Require source files to exactly match the original version setting under 
•	Debug->Options->General needs to be enabled..." To fix this, from the main 
•	menu select Tools > Options > Debugging > General and ensure that 
•	Require source files to exactly match the original version is checked. 
•	Understanding the Run and Debug shortcuts 
•	F5, or Debug > Start Debugging, starts a debugging session, if one isn't 
•	already active, and runs the program until a breakpoint is hit or the 
•	program needs user input. If no user input is needed and no breakpoint 
•	is available to hit, the program terminates and the console window closes 
•	itself when the program finishes running. If your program outputs to the 
•	console, use Ctrl+F5 or set a breakpoint before you press F5 to keep the 
•	window open. 
•	Ctrl+F5, or Debug > Start Without Debugging, runs the application 
•	without going into debug mode. This is slightly faster than debugging, 
•	and the console window stays open after the program finishes executing. 
•	F10, known as Step Over, lets you iterate through code, line-by-line, and 
•	visualize how the code is run and what variable values are at each step of 
•	execution.F11, known as Step Into, works similarly to Step Over, except it steps into 
•	any functions called on the line of execution. For example, if the line 
•	being executed calls a function, pressing F11 moves the pointer into the 
•	body of the function, so you can follow the function's code being run 
•	before coming back to the line you started at. Pressing F10 steps over the 
•	function call and just moves to the next line; the function call still 
•	happens, but the program doesn't pause to show you what it's doing. 
•	Close the app 
•	If it's still running, close the console window to stop the calculator app. 
•	Add Git source control 
•	Now that you've created an app, you might want to add it to a Git repository. We've got 
•	you covered. Visual Studio makes that process easy with Git tools you can use directly 
•	from the IDE. 
•	 Tip 
•	Git is the most widely used modern version control system, so whether you're a 
•	professional developer or you're learning how to code, Git can be very useful. If 
•	you're new to Git, the https://git-scm.com/ website is a good place to start. 
•	There, you can find cheat sheets, a popular online book, and Git Basics videos. 
•	To associate your code with Git, you start by creating a new Git repository where your 
•	code is located. Here's how: 
•	1. In the status bar at the bottom-right corner of Visual Studio, select Add to Source 
•	Control, and then select Git. 
•	2. In the Create a Git repository dialog box, sign in to GitHub.The repository name auto-populates based on your folder location. By default, 
•	your new repository is private, which means you're the only one who can access it. 
•	 Tip 
•	Whether your repository is public or private, it's best to have a remote backup 
•	of your code stored securely on GitHub. Even if you aren't working with a 
•	team, a remote repository makes your code available to you from any 
•	computer. 
•	3. Select Create and Push. 
•	After you create your repository, status details appear in the status bar. 
•	The first icon with the arrows shows how many outgoing/incoming commits are in 
•	your current branch. You can use this icon to pull any incoming commits or push 
•	any outgoing commits. You can also choose to view these commits first. To do so, 
•	select the icon, and then select View Outgoing/Incoming.Feedback 
•	Was this page helpful? 
•	Provide product feedback 
•	| Get help at Microsoft Q&A 
•	The second icon with the pencil shows the number of uncommitted changes to 
•	your code. You can select this icon to view those changes in the Git Changes 
•	window. 
•	To learn more about how to use Git with your app, see the Visual Studio version control 
•	documentation. 
•	Congratulations! You completed the code for the calculator app, built and debugged it, 
•	and added it to a repo, all in Visual Studio.

•	７ Note 
•	While we recommend that you develop with the latest versions of Visual Studio and 
•	the Windows SDK, if you're using Visual Studio 2017 (version 15.8.0 or later), and 
•	targeting the Windows SDK version 10.0.17134.0 (Windows 10, version 1803), then

•	A C++/WinRT quick-start 
•	Create a new Windows Console Application (C++/WinRT) project. 
•	Edit pch.h and main.cpp to look like this. 
•	C++/WinRT 
•	// pch.h 
•	#pragma once 
•	#include <winrt/Windows.Foundation.Collections.h>C++/WinRT 
•	Let's take the short code example above piece by piece, and explain what's going on in 
•	each part. 
•	C++/WinRT 
•	With the default project settings, the included headers come from the Windows SDK, 
•	inside the folder 
•	%WindowsSdkDir%Include<WindowsTargetPlatformVersion>\cppwinrt\winrt . Visual Studio 
•	includes that path in its IncludePath macro. But there's no strict dependency on the 
•	#include <winrt/Windows.Web.Syndication.h> 
•	#include <iostream> 
•	// main.cpp 
•	#include "pch.h" 
•	using namespace winrt; 
•	using namespace Windows::Foundation; 
•	using namespace Windows::Web::Syndication; 
•	int main() 
•	{ 
•	winrt::init_apartment(); 
•	Uri rssFeedUri{ L"https://blogs.windows.com/feed" }; 
•	SyndicationClient syndicationClient; 
•	syndicationClient.SetRequestHeader(L"User-Agent", L"Mozilla/5.0 
•	(compatible; MSIE 10.0; Windows NT 6.2; WOW64; Trident/6.0)"); 
•	SyndicationFeed syndicationFeed = 
•	syndicationClient.RetrieveFeedAsync(rssFeedUri).get(); 
•	for (const SyndicationItem syndicationItem : syndicationFeed.Items()) 
•	{ 
•	winrt::hstring titleAsHstring = syndicationItem.Title().Text(); 
•	// A workaround to remove the trademark symbol from the title 
•	string, because it causes issues in this case. 
•	std::wstring titleAsStdWstring{ titleAsHstring.c_str() }; 
•	titleAsStdWstring.erase(remove(titleAsStdWstring.begin(), 
•	titleAsStdWstring.end(), L'™'), titleAsStdWstring.end()); 
•	titleAsHstring = titleAsStdWstring; 
•	std::wcout << titleAsHstring.c_str() << std::endl; 
•	} 
•	} 
•	#include <winrt/Windows.Foundation.Collections.h> 
•	#include <winrt/Windows.Web.Syndication.h>Windows SDK, because your project (via the cppwinrt.exe tool) generates those same 
•	headers into your project's $(GeneratedFilesDir) folder. They'll be loaded from that 
•	folder if they can't be found elsewhere, or if you change your project settings. 
•	The headers contain Windows APIs projected into C++/WinRT. In other words, for each 
•	Windows type, C++/WinRT defines a C++-friendly equivalent (called the projected type). 
•	A projected type has the same fully-qualified name as the Windows type, but it's placed 
•	in the C++ winrt namespace. Putting these includes in your precompiled header 
•	reduces incremental build times. 
•	） Important 
•	Whenever you want to use a type from a Windows namespaces, you must #include 
•	the corresponding C++/WinRT Windows namespace header file, as shown above. 
•	The corresponding header is the one with the same name as the type's namespace. 
•	For example, to use the C++/WinRT projection for the 
•	Windows::Foundation::Collections::PropertySet runtime class, include the 
•	winrt/Windows.Foundation.Collections.h header. 
•	It is common for a C++/WinRT projection header to automatically include related 
•	namespace header files. For example, winrt/Windows.Foundation.Collections.h 
•	includes winrt/Windows.Foundation.h . But you shouldn't rely on this behavior, since 
•	it's an implementation detail that changes over time. You must explicitly include 
•	any headers that you need. 
•	C++/WinRT 
•	using namespace winrt; 
•	using namespace Windows::Foundation; 
•	using namespace Windows::Web::Syndication; 
•	The using namespace directives are optional, but convenient. The pattern shown above 
•	for such directives (allowing unqualified name lookup for anything in the winrt 
•	namespace) is suitable for when you're beginning a new project and C++/WinRT is the 
•	only language projection you're using inside of that project. If, on the other hand, you're 
•	mixing C++/WinRT code with C++/CX and/or SDK application binary interface (ABI) 
•	code (you're either porting from, or interoperating with, one or both of those models), 
•	then see the topics Interop between C++/WinRT and C++/CX, Move to C++/WinRT 
•	from C++/CX, and Interop between C++/WinRT and the ABI. 
•	C++/WinRTwinrt::init_apartment(); 
•	The call to winrt::init_apartment initializes the thread in the Windows Runtime; by 
•	default, in a multithreaded apartment. The call also initializes COM. 
•	C++/WinRT 
•	Uri rssFeedUri{ L"https://blogs.windows.com/feed" }; 
•	SyndicationClient syndicationClient; 
•	Stack-allocate two objects: they represent the uri of the Windows blog, and a 
•	syndication client. We construct the uri with a simple wide string literal (see String 
•	handling in C++/WinRT for more ways you can work with strings). 
•	C++/WinRT 
•	SyndicationFeed syndicationFeed = 
•	syndicationClient.RetrieveFeedAsync(rssFeedUri).get(); 
•	SyndicationClient::RetrieveFeedAsync is an example of an asynchronous Windows 
•	Runtime function. The code example receives an asynchronous operation object from 
•	RetrieveFeedAsync, and it calls get on that object to block the calling thread and wait 
•	for the result (which is a syndication feed, in this case). For more about concurrency, and 
•	for non-blocking techniques, see Concurrency and asynchronous operations with 
•	C++/WinRT. 
•	C++/WinRT 
•	for (const SyndicationItem syndicationItem : syndicationFeed.Items()) { ... 
•	} 
•	SyndicationFeed.Items is a range, defined by the iterators returned from begin and end 
•	functions (or their constant, reverse, and constant-reverse variants). Because of this, you 
•	can enumerate Items with either a range-based for statement, or with the std::for_each 
•	template function. Whenever you iterate over a Windows Runtime collection like this, 
•	you'll need to #include <winrt/Windows.Foundation.Collections.h> . 
•	C++/WinRT 
•	winrt::hstring titleAsHstring = syndicationItem.Title().Text(); 
•	// Omitted: there's a little bit of extra work here to remove the trademark 
•	symbol from the title text.std::wcout << titleAsHstring.c_str() << std::endl; 
•	Gets the feed's title text, as a winrt::hstring object (more details in String handling in 
•	C++/WinRT). The hstring is then output, via the c_str function, which reflects the pattern 
•	used with C++ Standard Library strings. 
•	As you can see, C++/WinRT encourages modern, and class-like, C++ expressions such 
•	as syndicationItem.Title().Text() . This is a different, and cleaner, programming style 
•	from traditional COM programming. You don't need to directly initialize COM, nor work 
•	with COM pointers. 
•	Nor do you need to handle HRESULT return codes. C++/WinRT converts error HRESULTs 
•	to exceptions such as winrt::hresult-error for a natural and modern programming style. 
•	For more info about error-handling, and code examples, see Error handling with 
•	C++/WinRT. 
•	Modify a Windows Desktop application project 
•	to add C++/WinRT support 
•	Some desktop projects (for example, the WinUI 3 templates in Visual Studio) have 
•	C++/WinRT support built in. 
•	But this section shows you how you can add C++/WinRT support to any Windows 
•	Desktop application project that you might have. If you don't have an existing Windows 
•	Desktop application project, then you can follow along with these steps by first creating 
•	one. For example, open Visual Studio and create a Visual C++ > Windows Desktop > 
•	Windows Desktop Application project. 
•	You can optionally install the C++/WinRT Visual Studio Extension (VSIX) and the 
•	NuGet package. For details, see Visual Studio support for C++/WinRT. 
•	Set project properties 
•	Go to project property General > Windows SDK Version, and select All Configurations 
•	and All Platforms. Ensure that Windows SDK Version is set to 10.0.17134.0 (Windows 
•	10, version 1803) or greater. 
•	Confirm that you're not affected by Why won't my new project compile?. 
•	Because C++/WinRT uses features from the C++17 standard, set project property 
•	C/C++ > Language > C++ Language Standard to ISO C++17 Standard (/std:c++17).The precompiled header 
•	The default project template creates a precompiled header for you, named either 
•	framework.h , or stdafx.h . Rename that to pch.h . If you have a stdafx.cpp file, then 
•	rename that to pch.cpp . Set project property C/C++ > Precompiled Headers > 
•	Precompiled Header to Create (/Yc), and Precompiled Header File to pch.h. 
•	Find and replace all #include "framework.h" (or #include "stdafx.h" ) with #include 
•	"pch.h" . 
•	In pch.h , include winrt/base.h . 
•	C++/WinRT 
•	// pch.h 
•	... 
•	#include <winrt/base.h> 
•	Linking 
•	The C++/WinRT language projection depends on certain Windows Runtime free (non 
•	member) functions, and entry points, that require linking to the WindowsApp.lib 
•	umbrella library. This section describes three ways of satisfying the linker. 
•	The first option is to add to your Visual Studio project all of the C++/WinRT MSBuild 
•	properties and targets. To do this, install the Microsoft.Windows.CppWinRT NuGet 
•	package into your project. Open the project in Visual Studio, click Project > Manage 
•	NuGet Packages... > Browse, type or paste Microsoft.Windows.CppWinRT in the search 
•	box, select the item in search results, and then click Install to install the package for that 
•	project. 
•	You can also use project link settings to explicitly link WindowsApp.lib . Or, you can do it 
•	in source code (in pch.h , for example) like this. 
•	C++/WinRT 
•	#pragma comment(lib, "windowsapp") 
•	You can now compile and link, and add C++/WinRT code to your project (for example, 
•	code similar to that shown in the A C++/WinRT quick-start section, above). 
•	The three main scenarios for C++/WinRTAs you use and become familiar with C++/WinRT, and work through the rest of the 
•	documentation here, you'll likely notice that there are three main scenarios, as described 
•	in the following sections. 
•	Consuming Windows APIs and types 
•	In other words, using, or calling APIs. For example, making API calls to communicate 
•	using Bluetooth; to stream and present video; to integrate with the Windows shell; and 
•	so on. C++/WinRT fully and uncompromisingly supports this category of scenario. For 
•	more info, see Consume APIs with C++/WinRT. 
•	Authoring Windows APIs and types 
•	In other words, producing APIs and types. For example, producing the kinds of APIs 
•	described in the section above; or the graphics APIs; the storage and file system APIs; 
•	the networking APIs, and so on. For more info, see Author APIs with C++/WinRT. 
•	Authoring APIs with C++/WinRT is a little more involved than consuming them, because 
•	you must use IDL to define the shape of the API before you can implement it. There's a 
•	walkthrough of doing that in XAML controls; bind to a C++/WinRT property. 
•	XAML applications 
•	This scenario is about building applications and controls on the XAML UI framework. 
•	Working in a XAML application amounts to a combination of consuming and authoring. 
•	But since XAML is the dominant UI framework on Windows today, and its influence over 
•	the Windows Runtime is proportionate to that, it deserves its own category of scenario. 
•	Be aware that XAML works best with programming languages that offer reflection. In 
•	C++/WinRT, you sometimes have to do a little extra work in order to interoperate with 
•	the XAML framework. All of those cases are covered in the documentation. Good places 
•	to start are XAML controls; bind to a C++/WinRT property and XAML custom 
•	(templated) controls with C++/WinRT.

•	The usual starting point for a C++ programmer is a "Hello, world!" application that runs 
•	on the command line. You start with that in this article, and then move on to something 
•	more challenging: a calculator app. 
•	Prerequisites 
•	Visual Studio with the Desktop development with C++ workload installed and 
•	running on your computer. To install it, see Install C++ support in Visual Studio. 
•	This tutorial demonstrates a feature called edit and continue which allows you to 
•	make changes to your code while the app is running. To enable edit and continue, 
•	from the main menu select Tools > Options > Debugging > General and ensure 
•	that Require source files to exactly match the original version is checked. 
•	Create your app project 
•	Visual Studio uses projects to organize the code for an app, and solutions to organize 
•	one or more projects. A project contains all the options, configurations, and rules used 
•	to build an app. It also manages the relationship between all the project's files and any 
•	external files. To create your app, first, create a new project and solution. 
•	1. Start Visual Studio--the Visual Studio Start dialog box appears. Select Create a new 
•	project to get started.2. In the Create a new project dialog, set the language dropdown to C++, set the 
•	platform dropdown to Windows, select Console App from the list of project types, 
•	then select Next. 
•	） Important 
•	Make sure you select the C++ version of the Console App template. It has the 
•	C++, Windows, and Console tags, and the icon has "++" in the corner.3. In the Configure your new project dialog box, select the Project name text box, 
•	name your new project CalculatorTutorial, then select Create. 
•	An empty C++ Windows console application 'Hello World' app is created. Console 
•	applications use a Windows console window to display output and accept user 
•	input. In Visual Studio, an editor window opens and shows the generated code: 
•	C++ 
•	// CalculatorTutorial.cpp : This file contains the 'main' function. 
•	Program execution begins and ends there. 
•	// 
•	#include <iostream> 
•	int main() 
•	{ 
•	std::cout << "Hello World!\n"; 
•	} 
•	// Run program: Ctrl + F5 or Debug > Start Without Debugging menu 
•	// Debug program: F5 or Debug > Start Debugging menu 
•	// Tips for Getting Started: 
•	// 1. Use the Solution Explorer window to add/manage files 
•	// 2. Use the Team Explorer window to connect to source control 
•	// 3. Use the Output window to see build output and other messages 
•	// 4. Use the Error List window to view errors 
•	// 5. Go to Project > Add New Item to create new code files, or 
•	Project > Add Existing Item to add existing code files to the project// 6. In the future, to open this project again, go to File > Open > 
•	Project and select the .sln file 
•	Verify that your new app builds and runs 
•	The template for a new Windows console application creates a simple C++ "Hello 
•	World" app. At this point, you can see how Visual Studio builds and runs the apps you 
•	create right from the IDE. 
•	1. To build your project, select Build Solution from the Build menu. The Output 
•	window shows the results of the build process. 
•	2. To run the code, on the menu bar, select Debug > Start without debugging 
•	(Ctrl+F5).A console window opens and your app runs within it. 
•	When you start a console app in Visual Studio, it runs your code, then prints "Press 
•	any key to close this window . . ." to give you a chance to see the output. 
•	Congratulations! You created your first "Hello, world!" console app in Visual Studio! 
•	3. Press a key to dismiss the console window and return to Visual Studio. 
•	You now have the tools to build and run your app after every change, to verify that the 
•	code still works as you expect. Later, we show you how to debug it if it doesn't. 
•	Now let's modify the code in this template to be a calculator app. 
•	1. Replace the contents of the CalculatorTutorial.cpp file with the following code so 
•	that it matches this example: 
•	C++ 
•	Edit the code 
•	// CalculatorTutorial.cpp : This file contains the 'main' function. 
•	Program execution begins and ends there. 
•	// 
•	#include <iostream> 
•	using namespace std; 
•	int main() 
•	{ 
•	cout << "Calculator Console Application" << endl << endl; 
•	cout << "Please enter the operation to perform. Format: a+b | a-b |Understanding the code: 
•	The #include statement brings in code in other files. Sometimes, you 
•	may see a filename surrounded by angle brackets like <iostream> . The 
•	angle brackets instruct the compiler to look for the iostream header file 
•	first in the standard system directories, and if not found, to look in 
•	directories specific to the project. Other times, you may see a filename 
•	surrounded by quotes like "someHeader.h" . The quotes instruct the 
•	compiler to skip looking in the standard system directories and instead 
•	only look in directories specific to the project. 
•	The using namespace std; tells the compiler to expect code from the 
•	C++ Standard Library to be used in this file. Without this line, each 
•	keyword from the library would have to be preceded with std:: to 
•	denote its scope. For instance, without that line, each reference to cout 
•	would be written as std::cout . The using statement is added to make it 
•	more convenient to access code in another namespace. 
•	The cout keyword is used to print to standard output in C++. The << 
•	operator tells the compiler to send whatever is to the right of it to the 
•	standard output. 
•	The endl keyword is like the Enter key; it ends the line and moves the 
•	cursor to the next line. It's a better practice to put a \n inside the string 
•	(contained by "" ) to do the same thing because endl always flushes the 
•	buffer which can hurt the performance of the program. But since this is a 
•	very small app, endl is used instead. 
•	All C++ statements must end with semicolons and all C++ applications 
•	must contain a main() function. This function is what the program runs at 
•	a*b | a/b" 
•	<< endl; 
•	return 0; 
•	} 
•	// Run program: Ctrl + F5 or Debug > Start Without Debugging menu 
•	// Debug program: F5 or Debug > Start Debugging menu 
•	// Tips for Getting Started:

•	2. To save the file, press Ctrl+S, or select the floppy disk icon in the toolbar under the 
•	menu bar. 
•	3. To run the application, press Ctrl+F5 or go to the Debug menu and select Start 
•	Without Debugging. You should see a console window appear that looks like this. 
•	4. Close the console window when you're done. 
•	Add code to do some math 
•	A class is like a blueprint for an object that does something. In this case, we define a 
•	calculator class to contain the math logic. 
•	Add a Calculator class 
•	1. Go to the Project menu and select Add Class. In the Class Name edit box, enter 
•	Calculator. Select OK. 
•	Two new files get added to your project. To save all your changed files at once, 
•	press Ctrl+Shift+S. It's a keyboard shortcut for File > Save All. There's also a 
•	toolbar button for Save All, an icon of two floppy disks, found beside the Savebutton. In general, it's good practice to do Save All frequently, so you don't miss 
•	saving any changes. 
•	The Add Class wizard creates .h and .cpp files that have the same name as the 
•	class. You can see a full list of your project files in the Solution Explorer window, 
•	visible on the side of the IDE. If the window isn't visible, open it from the menu bar 
•	via View > Solution Explorer. 
•	You can open a file by double-clicking it in the Solution Explorer window. Double 
•	click Calculator.h to open it. 
•	2. Replace the contents of Calculator.h with the following code so that the file now 
•	looks like this: 
•	C++ 
•	Understanding the code 
•	This code declares a new function called Calculate , which handles math 
•	operations for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. 
•	#pragma once 
•	class Calculator 
•	{ 
•	public: 
•	double Calculate(double x, char oper, double y); 
•	};C++ code is organized into header ( .h ) files and source ( .cpp ) files. 
•	Some other file extensions are supported by various compilers, but these 
•	are the main ones to know about. Functions and variables are normally 
•	declared, that is, given a name and a type, in header files, and 
•	implemented, or given a definition, in source files. To access code defined 
•	in another file, you can use #include "filename.h" , where filename.h is 
•	the name of the file that declares the variables or functions you want to 
•	use. 
•	It's good practice to organize your code into different files based on what 
•	it does, so it's easy to find the code you need later. In our case, we define 
•	the Calculator class separately from the file containing the main() 
•	function, but we plan to reference the Calculator class in main() . 
•	3. A green squiggle appears under Calculate because although the Calculate 
•	function is declared, it isn't defined. Hover over Calculate , click the down arrow on 
•	the screwdriver icon, and select Create definition of 'Calculate' in Calculator.cpp . 
•	This code is added to Calculator.cpp :Currently, it just returns 0.0. Let's change that. 
•	4. Switch to the Calculator.cpp file in the editor window. Replace the contents of 
•	Calculator::Calculate(double x, char oper, double y) with: 
•	C++ 
•	Understanding the code 
•	The function Calculate takes a number, an operator, and a second 
•	number. Then it performs the requested operation on the two numbers. 
•	The switch statement checks which operator was provided, and executes 
•	the case corresponding to that operation. The default: case is a fallback 
•	double Calculator::Calculate(double x, char oper, double y) 
•	{ 
•	switch(oper) 
•	{ 
•	case '+': 
•	return x + y; 
•	case '-': 
•	return x - y; 
•	case '*': 
•	return x * y; 
•	case '/': 
•	return x / y; 
•	default: 
•	return 0.0; 
•	} 
•	}in case the user types an operator that isn't handled by any of the 
•	preceding case statements. It's best to handle invalid user input in a 
•	more elegant way, but this is beyond the scope of this tutorial. 
•	The double keyword denotes a type of number that supports decimals. 
•	This type of number is called a floating-point number, and double means 
•	a floating point number that has extra precision. This way, the calculator 
•	can handle both decimal math and integer math. The Calculate function 
•	is required to always return a double-precision floating point number due 
•	to the double at the start of the code (this denotes the function's return 
•	type), which is why we return 0.0 in the default case. 
•	The .h file declares the function prototype, which tells the compiler 
•	upfront what parameters it requires, and what return type to expect from 
•	it. The .cpp file has all the implementation details of the function. 
•	If you build and run the code again at this point, it immediately exits after asking which 
•	operation to perform. So, modify the main function to do multiple calculations. 
•	1. Update the main function in CalculatorTutorial.cpp as follows: 
•	C++ 
•	Call the Calculator class member functions 
•	// CalculatorTutorial.cpp : This file contains the 'main' function. 
•	Program execution begins and ends there. 
•	// 
•	#include <iostream> 
•	#include "Calculator.h" 
•	using namespace std; 
•	int main() 
•	{ 
•	double x = 0.0; 
•	double y = 0.0; 
•	double result = 0.0; 
•	char oper = '+'; 
•	cout << "Calculator Console Application" << endl << endl; 
•	cout << "Please enter the operation to perform. Format: a+b | a-b | 
•	a*b | a/b" 
•	<< endl; 
•	Calculator c; 
•	while (true) 
•	{Understanding the code 
•	Since C++ programs always start at the main() function, we need to call 
•	our other code from there, so an #include statement is needed to make 
•	that code visible to our main() function. 
•	The variables x , y , oper , and result are declared to store the first 
•	number, second number, operator, and final result, respectively. It's 
•	always good practice to give them some initial values to avoid undefined 
•	behavior, which is what is done here. 
•	The Calculator c; line declares an object named c as an instance of the 
•	Calculator class. The class itself is just a blueprint for how calculators 
•	work; the object is the specific calculator that does the math. 
•	The while (true) statement is a loop. The code inside the loop executes 
•	over and over again as long as the condition inside the () holds true. 
•	Since the condition is simply listed as true , it's always true, so the loop 
•	runs forever. To close the program, the user must manually close the 
•	console window. Otherwise, the program always waits for new input. 
•	The cin keyword accepts input from the user. The input stream is smart 
•	enough to process a line of text entered in the console window and place 
•	it inside each of the variables listed, in order. 
•	The c.Calculate(x, oper, y); expression calls the Calculate function 
•	defined earlier, and supplies the entered input values and the requested 
•	operation. The function then returns a number that is stored in result . 
•	Finally, result is printed to the console and the user sees the result of 
•	the calculation. 
•	Now test the program again to make sure everything works properly. 
•	1. Press Ctrl+F5 to rebuild and start the app. 
•	2. Enter 5+5 , and press Enter. Verify that the result is 10. 
•	cin >> x >> oper >> y; 
•	result = c.Calculate(x, oper, y); 
•	cout << "Result " << "of " << x << oper << y << " is: " << 
•	result << endl; 
•	} 
•	return 0; 
•	} 
•	Build and test the code again3. Stop the program by closing the console window. 
•	Debug the app 
•	Since the user is free to type anything into the console window, let's make sure the 
•	calculator handles unexpected input. Instead of running the program, let's debug it so 
•	we can inspect what it's doing step-by-step. 
•	Run the app in the debugger 
•	1. In CalcuatorTutorial.cpp , set a breakpoint on the line: result = c.Calculate(x, 
•	oper, y); . To set the breakpoint, click next to the line in the gray vertical bar along 
•	the left edge of the editor window so that a red dot appears. 
•	Now when we debug the program, execution pauses at that line. We already have 
•	a rough idea that the program works for simple cases. Since we don't want to 
•	pause execution every time we call Calculate() , let's make the breakpoint 
•	conditional.2. Right-click the red dot that represents the breakpoint, and select Conditions. In 
•	the edit box for the condition, enter (y == 0) && (oper == '/') . Select the Close 
•	button to save the breakpoint condition. 
•	Now, execution pauses at the breakpoint when the app tries to divide by 0. 
•	3. To debug the program, press F5, or select the Local Windows Debugger debugger 
•	toolbar button that has the green arrow icon. In your console app, if you enter 
•	something like "5 - 0", the program behaves normally and keeps running. 
•	However, if you type "10 / 0", it pauses at the breakpoint. You can put any number 
•	of spaces between the operator and numbers: cin is smart enough to parse the 
•	input appropriately.Useful windows in the debugger 
•	When you debug your code, you may notice that some new windows appear. These 
•	windows can assist your debugging experience. Take a look at the Autos window. The 
•	Autos window shows you the current values of variables used at least three lines before 
•	and up to the current line. If you don't see the Autos window, from the main menu 
•	select Debug > Windows > Autos. 
•	To see all of the variables from that function, switch to the Locals window. Because this 
•	is a small function, the Autos and Locals window show the same variables. But you can 
•	modify the values of these variables in the Locals window while debugging to see what 
•	effect they would have on the program. In this case, we leave them alone. Open the 
•	Locals window by selecting Locals at the bottom of the Autos window, or by selecting 
•	from the main menu Debug > Windows > Locals.You can also hover over variables in the code to see their current values at the point 
•	where execution is currently paused. Make sure the editor window is in focus by clicking 
•	on it first. 
•	Continue debugging 
•	1. The yellow arrow on the left shows the current point of execution. The current line 
•	calls Calculate , so press F11 to Step Into the function. Now you're executing code 
•	in the body of the Calculate function. Be careful with Step Into because it steps 
•	into any functions on the line you're on, including standard library functions. It's 
•	fine to step into the standard library, but you may be more interested in focusing 
•	on your code instead of library code. 
•	2. Now that the point of execution is at the start of the Calculate function, press F10 
•	to move to the next line in the program's execution. F10 is also known as Step 
•	Over. You can use Step Over to move from line to line, without delving into the 
•	details of what is occurring in each part of the line. In general, you should use Step 
•	Over instead of Step Into unless you want to dive more deeply into code that is 
•	being called from elsewhere (as you did to reach the body of Calculate ). 
•	3. Continue using F10 to Step Over each line until you get back to the main() 
•	function in the other file, and stop on the cout line.The program is doing what's expected: it takes the first number, and divides it by 
•	the second. On the cout line, hover over the result variable or take a look at 
•	result in the Autos window. Its value is inf , which doesn't look right. 
•	Let's fix it. The cout line outputs whatever value is stored in result , so when you 
•	step one more line forward using F10, the console window displays: 
•	This result is because division by zero is undefined, so the program doesn't have a 
•	numerical answer for the requested operation. 
•	Fix the "divide by zero" error 
•	Let's handle division by zero more gracefully so that it's easier for the user to 
•	understand the problem. 
•	1. Make the following changes in CalculatorTutorial.cpp . You can leave the 
•	program running as you edit, thanks to a debugger feature called Edit andContinue. Add an if statement following cin >> x >> oper >> y; to check for 
•	division by zero and output a message to the user if it happens. Otherwise, the 
•	result is printed. 
•	C++ 
•	2. Press F5 once. Program execution continues until it has to pause to ask for user 
•	input. Enter 10 / 0 again. Now, a more helpful message is printed. The user is 
•	asked for more input, and the program continues executing normally. 
•	// CalculatorTutorial.cpp : This file contains the 'main' function. 
•	Program execution begins and ends there. 
•	// 
•	#include <iostream> 
•	#include "Calculator.h" 
•	using namespace std; 
•	int main() 
•	{ 
•	double x = 0.0; 
•	double y = 0.0; 
•	double result = 0.0; 
•	char oper = '+'; 
•	cout << "Calculator Console Application" << endl << endl; 
•	cout << "Please enter the operation to perform. Format: a+b | a-b | 
•	a*b | a/b" << endl; 
•	Calculator c; 
•	while (true) 
•	{ 
•	cin >> x >> oper >> y; 
•	if (oper == '/' && y == 0) 
•	{ 
•	cout << "Math error: Attempted to divide by zero!" << endl; 
•	continue; 
•	} 
•	else 
•	{ 
•	result = c.Calculate(x, oper, y); 
•	} 
•	cout << "Result " << "of " << x << oper << y << " is: " << 
•	result << endl; 
•	} 
•	return 0; 
•	}７ Note 
•	When you edit code while in debugging mode, there's a risk of code 
•	becoming stale. This happens when the debugger is still running your old 
•	code, and has not yet updated it with your changes. The debugger displays a 
•	dialog to inform you when this happens. Sometimes, you may need to press 
•	F5 to refresh the code being executed. In particular, if you make a change 
•	inside a function while the point of execution is inside that function, you need 
•	to step out of the function, then back into it again to get the updated code. If 
•	that doesn't work and you see an error message, you can stop debugging by 
•	clicking on the red square in the toolbar under the menus at the top of the 
•	IDE, then start debugging again by entering F5 or by choosing the green 
•	"play" arrow beside the stop button on the toolbar. 
•	Another reason edit and continue may fail is if you see a message that says 
•	"The Require source files to exactly match the original version setting under 
•	Debug->Options->General needs to be enabled..." To fix this, from the main 
•	menu select Tools > Options > Debugging > General and ensure that 
•	Require source files to exactly match the original version is checked. 
•	Understanding the Run and Debug shortcuts 
•	F5, or Debug > Start Debugging, starts a debugging session, if one isn't 
•	already active, and runs the program until a breakpoint is hit or the 
•	program needs user input. If no user input is needed and no breakpoint 
•	is available to hit, the program terminates and the console window closes 
•	itself when the program finishes running. If your program outputs to the 
•	console, use Ctrl+F5 or set a breakpoint before you press F5 to keep the 
•	window open. 
•	Ctrl+F5, or Debug > Start Without Debugging, runs the application 
•	without going into debug mode. This is slightly faster than debugging, 
•	and the console window stays open after the program finishes executing. 
•	F10, known as Step Over, lets you iterate through code, line-by-line, and 
•	visualize how the code is run and what variable values are at each step of 
•	execution.F11, known as Step Into, works similarly to Step Over, except it steps into 
•	any functions called on the line of execution. For example, if the line 
•	being executed calls a function, pressing F11 moves the pointer into the 
•	body of the function, so you can follow the function's code being run 
•	before coming back to the line you started at. Pressing F10 steps over the 
•	function call and just moves to the next line; the function call still 
•	happens, but the program doesn't pause to show you what it's doing. 
•	Close the app 
•	If it's still running, close the console window to stop the calculator app. 
•	Add Git source control 
•	Now that you've created an app, you might want to add it to a Git repository. We've got 
•	you covered. Visual Studio makes that process easy with Git tools you can use directly 
•	from the IDE. 
•	 Tip 
•	Git is the most widely used modern version control system, so whether you're a 
•	professional developer or you're learning how to code, Git can be very useful. If 
•	you're new to Git, the https://git-scm.com/ website is a good place to start. 
•	There, you can find cheat sheets, a popular online book, and Git Basics videos. 
•	To associate your code with Git, you start by creating a new Git repository where your 
•	code is located. Here's how: 
•	1. In the status bar at the bottom-right corner of Visual Studio, select Add to Source 
•	Control, and then select Git. 
•	2. In the Create a Git repository dialog box, sign in to GitHub.The repository name auto-populates based on your folder location. By default, 
•	your new repository is private, which means you're the only one who can access it. 
•	 Tip 
•	Whether your repository is public or private, it's best to have a remote backup 
•	of your code stored securely on GitHub. Even if you aren't working with a 
•	team, a remote repository makes your code available to you from any 
•	computer. 
•	3. Select Create and Push. 
•	After you create your repository, status details appear in the status bar. 
•	The first icon with the arrows shows how many outgoing/incoming commits are in 
•	your current branch. You can use this icon to pull any incoming commits or push 
•	any outgoing commits. You can also choose to view these commits first. To do so, 
•	select the icon, and then select View Outgoing/Incoming.Feedback 
•	Was this page helpful? 
•	Provide product feedback 
•	| Get help at Microsoft Q&A 
•	The second icon with the pencil shows the number of uncommitted changes to 
•	your code. You can select this icon to view those changes in the Git Changes 
•	window. 
•	To learn more about how to use Git with your app, see the Visual Studio version control 
•	documentation.

•	#pragma once 
•	#include <winrt/Windows.Foundation.Collections.h>C++/WinRT 
•	Let's take the short code example above piece by piece, and explain what's going on in 
•	each part. 
•	C++/WinRT 
•	With the default project settings, the included headers come from the Windows SDK, 
•	inside the folder 
•	%WindowsSdkDir%Include<WindowsTargetPlatformVersion>\cppwinrt\winrt . Visual Studio 
•	includes that path in its IncludePath macro. But there's no strict dependency on the 
•	#include <winrt/Windows.Web.Syndication.h> 
•	#include <iostream> 
•	// main.cpp 
•	#include "pch.h" 
•	using namespace winrt; 
•	using namespace Windows::Foundation; 
•	using namespace Windows::Web::Syndication; 
•	int main() 
•	{ 
•	winrt::init_apartment(); 
•	Uri rssFeedUri{ L"https://blogs.windows.com/feed" }; 
•	SyndicationClient syndicationClient; 
•	syndicationClient.SetRequestHeader(L"User-Agent", L"Mozilla/5.0 
•	(compatible; MSIE 10.0; Windows NT 6.2; WOW64; Trident/6.0)"); 
•	SyndicationFeed syndicationFeed = 
•	syndicationClient.RetrieveFeedAsync(rssFeedUri).get(); 
•	for (const SyndicationItem syndicationItem : syndicationFeed.Items()) 
•	{ 
•	winrt::hstring titleAsHstring = syndicationItem.Title().Text(); 
•	// A workaround to remove the trademark symbol from the title 
•	string, because it causes issues in this case. 
•	std::wstring titleAsStdWstring{ titleAsHstring.c_str() }; 
•	titleAsStdWstring.erase(remove(titleAsStdWstring.begin(), 
•	titleAsStdWstring.end(), L'™'), titleAsStdWstring.end()); 
•	titleAsHstring = titleAsStdWstring; 
•	std::wcout << titleAsHstring.c_str() << std::endl; 
•	} 
•	} 
•	#include <winrt/Windows.Foundation.Collections.h> 
•	#include <winrt/Windows.Web.Syndication.h>Windows SDK, because your project (via the cppwinrt.exe tool) generates those same 
•	headers into your project's $(GeneratedFilesDir) folder. They'll be loaded from that 
•	folder if they can't be found elsewhere, or if you change your project settings. 
•	The headers contain Windows APIs projected into C++/WinRT. In other words, for each 
•	Windows type, C++/WinRT defines a C++-friendly equivalent (called the projected type). 
•	A projected type has the same fully-qualified name as the Windows type, but it's placed 
•	in the C++ winrt namespace. Putting these includes in your precompiled header 
•	reduces incremental build times. 
•	） Important 
•	Whenever you want to use a type from a Windows namespaces, you must #include 
•	the corresponding C++/WinRT Windows namespace header file, as shown above. 
•	The corresponding header is the one with the same name as the type's namespace. 
•	For example, to use the C++/WinRT projection for the 
•	Windows::Foundation::Collections::PropertySet runtime class, include the 
•	winrt/Windows.Foundation.Collections.h header. 
•	It is common for a C++/WinRT projection header to automatically include related 
•	namespace header files. For example, winrt/Windows.Foundation.Collections.h 
•	includes winrt/Windows.Foundation.h . But you shouldn't rely on this behavior, since 
•	it's an implementation detail that changes over time. You must explicitly include 
•	any headers that you need. 
•	C++/WinRT 
•	using namespace winrt; 
•	using namespace Windows::Foundation; 
•	using namespace Windows::Web::Syndication; 
•	The using namespace directives are optional, but convenient. The pattern shown above 
•	for such directives (allowing unqualified name lookup for anything in the winrt 
•	namespace) is suitable for when you're beginning a new project and C++/WinRT is the 
•	only language projection you're using inside of that project. If, on the other hand, you're 
•	mixing C++/WinRT code with C++/CX and/or SDK application binary interface (ABI) 
•	code (you're either porting from, or interoperating with, one or both of those models), 
•	then see the topics Interop between C++/WinRT and C++/CX, Move to C++/WinRT 
•	from C++/CX, and Interop between C++/WinRT and the ABI. 
•	C++/WinRTwinrt::init_apartment(); 
•	The call to winrt::init_apartment initializes the thread in the Windows Runtime; by 
•	default, in a multithreaded apartment. The call also initializes COM. 
•	C++/WinRT 
•	Uri rssFeedUri{ L"https://blogs.windows.com/feed" }; 
•	SyndicationClient syndicationClient; 
•	Stack-allocate two objects: they represent the uri of the Windows blog, and a 
•	syndication client. We construct the uri with a simple wide string literal (see String 
•	handling in C++/WinRT for more ways you can work with strings). 
•	C++/WinRT 
•	SyndicationFeed syndicationFeed = 
•	syndicationClient.RetrieveFeedAsync(rssFeedUri).get(); 
•	SyndicationClient::RetrieveFeedAsync is an example of an asynchronous Windows 
•	Runtime function. The code example receives an asynchronous operation object from 
•	RetrieveFeedAsync, and it calls get on that object to block the calling thread and wait 
•	for the result (which is a syndication feed, in this case). For more about concurrency, and 
•	for non-blocking techniques, see Concurrency and asynchronous operations with 
•	C++/WinRT. 
•	C++/WinRT 
•	for (const SyndicationItem syndicationItem : syndicationFeed.Items()) { ... 
•	} 
•	SyndicationFeed.Items is a range, defined by the iterators returned from begin and end 
•	functions (or their constant, reverse, and constant-reverse variants). Because of this, you 
•	can enumerate Items with either a range-based for statement, or with the std::for_each 
•	template function. Whenever you iterate over a Windows Runtime collection like this, 
•	you'll need to #include <winrt/Windows.Foundation.Collections.h> . 
•	C++/WinRT 
•	winrt::hstring titleAsHstring = syndicationItem.Title().Text(); 
•	// Omitted: there's a little bit of extra work here to remove the trademark 
•	symbol from the title text.std::wcout << titleAsHstring.c_str() << std::endl; 
•	Gets the feed's title text, as a winrt::hstring object (more details in String handling in 
•	C++/WinRT). The hstring is then output, via the c_str function, which reflects the pattern 
•	used with C++ Standard Library strings. 
•	As you can see, C++/WinRT encourages modern, and class-like, C++ expressions such 
•	as syndicationItem.Title().Text() . This is a different, and cleaner, programming style 
•	from traditional COM programming. You don't need to directly initialize COM, nor work 
•	with COM pointers. 
•	Nor do you need to handle HRESULT return codes. C++/WinRT converts error HRESULTs 
•	to exceptions such as winrt::hresult-error for a natural and modern programming style. 
•	For more info about error-handling, and code examples, see Error handling with 
•	C++/WinRT. 
•	Modify a Windows Desktop application project 
•	to add C++/WinRT support 
•	Some desktop projects (for example, the WinUI 3 templates in Visual Studio) have 
•	C++/WinRT support built in. 
•	But this section shows you how you can add C++/WinRT support to any Windows 
•	Desktop application project that you might have. If you don't have an existing Windows 
•	Desktop application project, then you can follow along with these steps by first creating 
•	one. For example, open Visual Studio and create a Visual C++ > Windows Desktop > 
•	Windows Desktop Application project. 
•	You can optionally install the C++/WinRT Visual Studio Extension (VSIX) and the 
•	NuGet package. For details, see Visual Studio support for C++/WinRT. 
•	Set project properties 
•	Go to project property General > Windows SDK Version, and select All Configurations 
•	and All Platforms. Ensure that Windows SDK Version is set to 10.0.17134.0 (Windows 
•	10, version 1803) or greater. 
•	Confirm that you're not affected by Why won't my new project compile?. 
•	Because C++/WinRT uses features from the C++17 standard, set project property 
•	C/C++ > Language > C++ Language Standard to ISO C++17 Standard (/std:c++17).The precompiled header 
•	The default project template creates a precompiled header for you, named either 
•	framework.h , or stdafx.h . Rename that to pch.h . If you have a stdafx.cpp file, then 
•	rename that to pch.cpp . Set project property C/C++ > Precompiled Headers > 
•	Precompiled Header to Create (/Yc), and Precompiled Header File to pch.h. 
•	Find and replace all #include "framework.h" (or #include "stdafx.h" ) with #include 
•	"pch.h" . 
•	In pch.h , include winrt/base.h . 
•	C++/WinRT 
•	// pch.h 
•	... 
•	#include <winrt/base.h> 
•	Linking 
•	The C++/WinRT language projection depends on certain Windows Runtime free (non 
•	member) functions, and entry points, that require linking to the WindowsApp.lib 
•	umbrella library. This section describes three ways of satisfying the linker. 
•	The first option is to add to your Visual Studio project all of the C++/WinRT MSBuild 
•	properties and targets. To do this, install the Microsoft.Windows.CppWinRT NuGet 
•	package into your project. Open the project in Visual Studio, click Project > Manage 
•	NuGet Packages... > Browse, type or paste Microsoft.Windows.CppWinRT in the search 
•	box, select the item in search results, and then click Install to install the package for that 
•	project. 
•	You can also use project link settings to explicitly link WindowsApp.lib . Or, you can do it 
•	in source code (in pch.h , for example) like this. 
•	C++/WinRT 
•	#pragma comment(lib, "windowsapp") 
•	You can now compile and link, and add C++/WinRT code to your project (for example, 
•	code similar to that shown in the A C++/WinRT quick-start section, above). 
•	The three main scenarios for C++/WinRTAs you use and become familiar with C++/WinRT, and work through the rest of the 
•	documentation here, you'll likely notice that there are three main scenarios, as described 
•	in the following sections. 
•	Consuming Windows APIs and types 
•	In other words, using, or calling APIs. For example, making API calls to communicate 
•	using Bluetooth; to stream and present video; to integrate with the Windows shell; and 
•	so on. C++/WinRT fully and uncompromisingly supports this category of scenario. For 
•	more info, see Consume APIs with C++/WinRT. 
•	Authoring Windows APIs and types 
•	In other words, producing APIs and types. For example, producing the kinds of APIs 
•	described in the section above; or the graphics APIs; the storage and file system APIs; 
•	the networking APIs, and so on. For more info, see Author APIs with C++/WinRT. 
•	Authoring APIs with C++/WinRT is a little more involved than consuming them, because 
•	you must use IDL to define the shape of the API before you can implement it. There's a 
•	walkthrough of doing that in XAML controls; bind to a C++/WinRT property. 
•	XAML applications 
•	This scenario is about building applications and controls on the XAML UI framework. 
•	Working in a XAML application amounts to a combination of consuming and authoring. 
•	But since XAML is the dominant UI framework on Windows today, and its influence over 
•	the Windows Runtime is proportionate to that, it deserves its own category of scenario. 
•	Be aware that XAML works best with programming languages that offer reflection. In 
•	C++/WinRT, you sometimes have to do a little extra work in order to interoperate with 
•	the XAML framework. All of those cases are covered in the documentation. Good places 
•	to start are XAML controls; bind to a C++/WinRT property and XAML custom 
•	(templated) controls with C++/WinRT.

•	Article • 02/14/2023 
•	An MFC application is an executable application for Windows that is based on the 
•	Microsoft Foundation Class (MFC) Library. MFC executables generally fall into five types: 
•	standard Windows applications, dialog boxes, forms-based applications, Explorer-style 
•	applications, and Web browser-style applications. For more information, see: 
•	Using the Classes to Write Windows Applications 
•	Creating and Displaying Dialog Boxes 
•	Creating a Forms-Based MFC Application 
•	Creating a File Explorer-Style MFC Application 
•	Creating a Web Browser-Style MFC Application 
•	The MFC Application Wizard generates the appropriate classes and files for any of these 
•	types of applications, depending on the options you select in the wizard. 
•	The easiest way to create an MFC application is to use the MFC Application Wizard (MFC 
•	App project in Visual Studio 2019). To create an MFC console application (a command 
•	line program that uses MFC libraries but runs in the console window), use the Windows 
•	Desktop Wizard and choose the Console Application and MFC Headers options. 
•	To create an MFC forms or dialog-based 
•	application 
•	1. From the main menu, choose File > New > Project. 
•	2. Enter "MFC" into the search box and then choose MFC App from the result list. 
•	3. Modify the defaults as needed, then press Create to open the MFC Application 
•	Wizard. 
•	4. Modify the configuration values as needed, then press Finish. 
•	For more information, see Creating a forms-based MFC application.To create an MFC console application 
•	An MFC console application is a command-line program that uses MFC libraries but

•	Dynamic Link Library (C++) 
•	Article • 12/10/2021 
•	This step-by-step walkthrough shows how to use the Visual Studio IDE to create your 
•	own dynamic link library (DLL) written in Microsoft C++ (MSVC). Then it shows how to 
•	use the DLL from another C++ app. DLLs (also known as shared libraries in UNIX-based 
•	operating systems) are one of the most useful kinds of Windows components. You can 
•	use them as a way to share code and resources, and to shrink the size of your apps. 
•	DLLs can even make it easier to service and extend your apps. 
•	In this walkthrough, you'll create a DLL that implements some math functions. Then 
•	you'll create a console app that uses the functions from the DLL. You'll also get an 
•	introduction to some of the programming techniques and conventions used in Windows 
•	DLLs. 
•	This walkthrough covers these tasks: 
•	Create a DLL project in Visual Studio. 
•	Add exported functions and variables to the DLL. 
•	Create a console app project in Visual Studio. 
•	Use the functions and variables imported from the DLL in the console app. 
•	Run the completed app. 
•	Like a statically linked library, a DLL exports variables, functions, and resources by name. 
•	A client app imports the names to use those variables, functions, and resources. Unlike a 
•	statically linked library, Windows connects the imports in your app to the exports in a 
•	DLL at load time or at run time, instead of connecting them at link time. Windows 
•	requires extra information that isn't part of the standard C++ compilation model to 
•	make these connections. The MSVC compiler implements some Microsoft-specific 
•	extensions to C++ to provide this extra information. We explain these extensions as we 
•	go. 
•	This walkthrough creates two Visual Studio solutions; one that builds the DLL, and one 
•	that builds the client app. The DLL uses the C calling convention. It can be called from 
•	apps written in other programming languages, as long as the platform, calling 
•	conventions, and linking conventions match. The client app uses implicit linking, whereWindows links the app to the DLL at load-time. This linking lets the app call the DLL 
•	supplied functions just like the functions in a statically linked library. 
•	This walkthrough doesn't cover some common situations. The code doesn't show the 
•	use of C++ DLLs by other programming languages. It doesn't show how to create a 
•	resource-only DLL, or how to use explicit linking to load DLLs at run-time rather than at 
•	load-time. Rest assured, you can use MSVC and Visual Studio to do all these things. 
•	Even though the code of the DLL is written in C++, we've used C-style interfaces for the 
•	exported functions. There are two main reasons for this: First, many other languages 
•	support imports of C-style functions. The client app doesn't have to be written in C++. 
•	Second, it avoids some common pitfalls related to exported classes and member 
•	functions. It's easy to make hard-to-diagnose errors when exporting classes, since 
•	everything referred to within a class declaration has to have an instantiation that's also 
•	exported. This restriction applies to DLLs, but not static libraries. If your classes are plain 
•	old-data style, you shouldn't run into this issue. 
•	For links to more information about DLLs, see Create C/C++ DLLs in Visual Studio. For 
•	more information about implicit linking and explicit linking, see Determine which linking 
•	method to use. For information about creating C++ DLLs for use with programming 
•	languages that use C-language linkage conventions, see Exporting C++ functions for 
•	use in C-language executables. For information about how to create DLLs for use with 
•	.NET languages, see Calling DLL Functions from Visual Basic Applications. 
•	Prerequisites 
•	A computer that runs Microsoft Windows 7 or later versions. We recommend the 
•	latest version of Windows for the best development experience. 
•	A copy of Visual Studio. For information on how to download and install Visual 
•	Studio, see Install Visual Studio. When you run the installer, make sure that the 
•	Desktop development with C++ workload is checked. Don't worry if you didn't 
•	install this workload when you installed Visual Studio. You can run the installer 
•	again and install it now. 
•	An understanding of the basics of using the Visual Studio IDE. If you've used 
•	Windows desktop apps before, you can probably keep up. For an introduction, seeVisual Studio IDE feature tour. 
•	An understanding of enough of the fundamentals of the C++ language to follow 
•	along. Don't worry, we don't do anything too complicated. 
•	Create the DLL project 
•	In this set of tasks, you create a project for your DLL, add code, and build it. To begin, 
•	start the Visual Studio IDE, and sign in if you need to. The instructions vary slightly 
•	depending on which version of Visual Studio you're using. Make sure you have the 
•	correct version selected in the control in the upper left of this page. 
•	To create a DLL project in Visual Studio 2019 
•	1. On the menu bar, choose File > New > Project to open the Create a New Project 
•	dialog box. 
•	2. At the top of the dialog, set Language to C++, set Platform to Windows, and set 
•	Project type to Library. 
•	3. From the filtered list of project types, select Dynamic-link Library (DLL), and then 
•	choose Next. 
•	4. In the Configure your new project page, enter MathLibrary in the Project name 
•	box to specify a name for the project. Leave the default Location and Solution 
•	name values. Set Solution to Create new solution. Uncheck Place solution and 
•	project in the same directory if it's checked. 
•	5. Choose the Create button to create the project.When the solution is created, you can see the generated project and source files in the 
•	Solution Explorer window in Visual Studio. 
•	Right now, this DLL doesn't do very much. Next, you'll create a header file to declare the 
•	functions your DLL exports, and then add the function definitions to the DLL to make it 
•	more useful. 
•	To add a header file to the DLL 
•	1. To create a header file for your functions, on the menu bar, choose Project > Add 
•	New Item. 
•	2. In the Add New Item dialog box, in the left pane, select Visual C++. In the center 
•	pane, select Header File (.h). Specify MathLibrary.h as the name for the header file.3. Choose the Add button to generate a blank header file, which is displayed in a new 
•	editor window. 
•	4. Replace the contents of the header file with this code: 
•	C++ 
•	// MathLibrary.h - Contains declarations of math functions 
•	#pragma once 
•	#ifdef MATHLIBRARY_EXPORTS 
•	#define MATHLIBRARY_API __declspec(dllexport) 
•	#else 
•	#define MATHLIBRARY_API __declspec(dllimport) 
•	#endif 
•	// The Fibonacci recurrence relation describes a sequence F 
•	// where F(n) is { n = 0, a 
•	// { n = 1, bThis header file declares some functions to produce a generalized Fibonacci sequence, 
•	given two initial values. A call to fibonacci_init(1, 1) generates the familiar Fibonacci 
•	number sequence. 
•	Notice the preprocessor statements at the top of the file. The new project template for a 
•	DLL project adds <PROJECTNAME>_EXPORTS to the defined preprocessor macros. In this 
•	example, Visual Studio defines MATHLIBRARY_EXPORTS when your MathLibrary DLL project 
•	is built. 
•	When the MATHLIBRARY_EXPORTS macro is defined, the MATHLIBRARY_API macro sets the 
•	__declspec(dllexport) modifier on the function declarations. This modifier tells the 
•	compiler and linker to export a function or variable from the DLL for use by other 
•	applications. When MATHLIBRARY_EXPORTS is undefined, for example, when the header file 
•	is included by a client application, MATHLIBRARY_API applies the __declspec(dllimport) 
•	modifier to the declarations. This modifier optimizes the import of the function or 
•	variable in an application. For more information, see dllexport, dllimport. 
•	1. In Solution Explorer, right-click on the Source Files node and choose Add > New 
•	Item. Create a new .cpp file called MathLibrary.cpp, in the same way that you 
•	added a new header file in the previous step. 
•	// { n > 1, F(n-2) + F(n-1) 
•	// for some initial integral values a and b. 
•	// If the sequence is initialized F(0) = 1, F(1) = 1, 
•	// then this relation produces the well-known Fibonacci 
•	// sequence: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ... 
•	// Initialize a Fibonacci relation sequence 
•	// such that F(0) = a, F(1) = b. 
•	// This function must be called before any other function. 
•	extern "C" MATHLIBRARY_API void fibonacci_init( 
•	const unsigned long long a, const unsigned long long b); 
•	// Produce the next value in the sequence. 
•	// Returns true on success and updates current value and index; 
•	// false on overflow, leaves current value and index unchanged. 
•	extern "C" MATHLIBRARY_API bool fibonacci_next(); 
•	// Get the current value in the sequence. 
•	extern "C" MATHLIBRARY_API unsigned long long fibonacci_current(); 
•	// Get the position of the current value in the sequence. 
•	extern "C" MATHLIBRARY_API unsigned fibonacci_index(); 
•	To add an implementation to the DLL2. In the editor window, select the tab for MathLibrary.cpp if it's already open. If not, 
•	in Solution Explorer, double-click MathLibrary.cpp in the Source Files folder of the 
•	MathLibrary project to open it. 
•	3. In the editor, replace the contents of the MathLibrary.cpp file with the following 
•	code: 
•	C++ 
•	// MathLibrary.cpp : Defines the exported functions for the DLL. 
•	#include "pch.h" // use stdafx.h in Visual Studio 2017 and earlier 
•	#include <utility> 
•	#include <limits.h> 
•	#include "MathLibrary.h" 
•	// DLL internal state variables: 
•	static unsigned long long previous_; // Previous value, if any 
•	static unsigned long long current_; // Current sequence value 
•	static unsigned index_; // Current seq. position 
•	// Initialize a Fibonacci relation sequence 
•	// such that F(0) = a, F(1) = b. 
•	// This function must be called before any other function. 
•	void fibonacci_init( 
•	const unsigned long long a, 
•	const unsigned long long b) 
•	{ 
•	index_ = 0; 
•	current_ = a; 
•	previous_ = b; // see special case when initialized 
•	} 
•	// Produce the next value in the sequence. 
•	// Returns true on success, false on overflow. 
•	bool fibonacci_next() 
•	{ 
•	// check to see if we'd overflow result or position 
•	if ((ULLONG_MAX - previous_ < current_) || 
•	(UINT_MAX == index_)) 
•	{ 
•	return false; 
•	} 
•	// Special case when index == 0, just return b value 
•	if (index_ > 0) 
•	{ 
•	// otherwise, calculate next sequence value 
•	previous_ += current_; 
•	} 
•	std::swap(current_, previous_); 
•	++index_; 
•	return true; 
•	}To verify that everything works so far, compile the dynamic link library. To compile, 
•	choose Build > Build Solution on the menu bar. The DLL and related compiler output 
•	are placed in a folder called Debug directly below the solution folder. If you create a 
•	Release build, the output is placed in a folder called Release. The output should look

•	When you create a DLL, think about how client apps may use it. To call the functions or

•	function calls or data accesses. A DLL supplies this information in an import library, a file 
•	that contains information about how to find the functions and data, instead of the actual 
•	code. And at run time, the DLL must be available to the client, in a location that the 
•	operating system can find.

•	Create a client app that uses the DLLWhether it's your own or from a third-party, your client app project needs several pieces 
•	of information to use a DLL. It needs to find the headers that declare the DLL exports, 
•	the import libraries for the linker, and the DLL itself. One solution is to copy all of these 
•	files into your client project. For third-party DLLs that are unlikely to change while your 
•	client is in development, this method may be the best way to use them. However, when 
•	you also build the DLL, it's better to avoid duplication. If you make a local copy of DLL 
•	files that are under development, you may accidentally change a header file in one copy 
•	but not the other, or use an out-of-date library. 
•	To avoid out-of-sync code, we recommend you set the include path in your client 
•	project to include the DLL header files directly from your DLL project. Also, set the 
•	library path in your client project to include the DLL import libraries from the DLL 
•	project. And finally, copy the built DLL from the DLL project into your client build output 
•	directory. This step allows your client app to use the same DLL code you build. 
•	To create a client app in Visual Studio 
•	1. On the menu bar, choose File > New > Project to open the Create a new project 
•	dialog box. 
•	2. At the top of the dialog, set Language to C++, set Platform to Windows, and set 
•	Project type to Console. 
•	3. From the filtered list of project types, choose Console App then choose Next. 
•	4. In the Configure your new project page, enter MathClient in the Project name box 
•	to specify a name for the project. Leave the default Location and Solution name 
•	values. Set Solution to Create new solution. Uncheck Place solution and project in 
•	the same directory if it's checked. 
•	5. Choose the Create button to create the client project.A minimal console application project is created for you. The name for the main source 
•	file is the same as the project name that you entered earlier. In this example, it's named 
•	MathClient.cpp. You can build it, but it doesn't use your DLL yet. 
•	Next, to call the MathLibrary functions in your source code, your project must include 
•	the MathLibrary.h file. You could copy this header file into your client app project, then 
•	add it to the project as an existing item. This method can be a good choice for third 
•	party libraries. However, if you're working on the code for your DLL and your client at 
•	the same time, the header files could get out of sync. To avoid this issue, set the 
•	Additional Include Directories path in your project to include the path to the original 
•	header. 
•	To add the DLL header to your include path 
•	1. Right-click on the MathClient node in Solution Explorer to open the Property 
•	Pages dialog. 
•	2. In the Configuration drop-down box, select All Configurations if it's not already 
•	selected. 
•	3. In the left pane, select Configuration Properties > C/C++ > General. 
•	4. In the property pane, select the drop-down control next to the Additional Include 
•	Directories edit box, and then choose Edit.5. Double-click in the top pane of the Additional Include Directories dialog box to 
•	enable an edit control. Or, choose the folder icon to create a new entry. 
•	6. In the edit control, specify the path to the location of the MathLibrary.h header 
•	file. You can choose the ellipsis (...) control to browse to the correct folder. 
•	You can also enter a relative path from your client source files to the folder that 
•	contains the DLL header files. If you followed the directions to put your client 
•	project in a separate solution from the DLL, the relative path should look like this: 
•	..\..\MathLibrary\MathLibrary 
•	If your DLL and client projects are in the same solution, the relative path might 
•	look like this: 
•	..\MathLibrary 
•	When the DLL and client projects are in other folders, adjust the relative path to 
•	match. Or, use the ellipsis control to browse for the folder. 
•	7. After you've entered the path to the header file in the Additional Include 
•	Directories dialog box, choose the OK button. In the Property Pages dialog box, 
•	choose the OK button to save your changes. 
•	You can now include the MathLibrary.h file and use the functions it declares in your 
•	client application. Replace the contents of MathClient.cpp by using this code: 
•	C++This code can be compiled, but not linked. If you build the client app now, the error list 
•	shows several LNK2019 errors. That's because your project is missing some information: 
•	You haven't specified that your project has a dependency on the MathLibrary.lib library 
•	yet. And, you haven't told the linker how to find the MathLibrary.lib file. 
•	To fix this issue, you could copy the library file directly into your client app project. The 
•	linker would find and use it automatically. However, if both the library and the client app 
•	are under development, that might lead to changes in one copy that aren't shown in the 
•	other. To avoid this issue, you can set the Additional Dependencies property to tell the 
•	build system that your project depends on MathLibrary.lib. And, you can set an 
•	Additional Library Directories path in your project to include the path to the original 
•	library when you link. 
•	1. Right-click on the MathClient node in Solution Explorer and choose Properties to 
•	open the Property Pages dialog. 
•	2. In the Configuration drop-down box, select All Configurations if it's not already 
•	selected. It ensures that any property changes apply to both Debug and Release 
•	builds. 
•	3. In the left pane, select Configuration Properties > Linker > Input. In the property 
•	pane, select the drop-down control next to the Additional Dependencies edit box, 
•	and then choose Edit. 
•	// MathClient.cpp : Client app for MathLibrary DLL. 
•	// #include "pch.h" Uncomment for Visual Studio 2017 and earlier

•	} 
•	To add the DLL import library to your project4. In the Additional Dependencies dialog, add MathLibrary.lib to the list in the top 
•	edit control. 
•	5. Choose OK to go back to the Property Pages dialog box. 
•	6. In the left pane, select Configuration Properties > Linker > General. In the 
•	property pane, select the drop-down control next to the Additional Library 
•	Directories edit box, and then choose Edit.7. Double-click in the top pane of the Additional Library Directories dialog box to 
•	enable an edit control. In the edit control, specify the path to the location of the 
•	MathLibrary.lib file. By default, it's in a folder called Debug directly under the DLL 
•	solution folder. If you create a release build, the file is placed in a folder called 
•	Release. You can use the $(IntDir) macro so that the linker can find your DLL, no 
•	matter which kind of build you create. If you followed the directions to put your 
•	client project in a separate solution from the DLL project, the relative path should 
•	look like this: 
•	..\..\MathLibrary\$(IntDir) 
•	If your DLL and client projects are in other locations, adjust the relative path to 
•	match.8. Once you've entered the path to the library file in the Additional Library 
•	Directories dialog box, choose the OK button to go back to the Property Pages 
•	dialog box. Choose OK to save the property changes. 
•	Your client app can now compile and link successfully, but it still doesn't have everything 
•	it needs to run. When the operating system loads your app, it looks for the MathLibrary 
•	DLL. If it can't find the DLL in certain system directories, the environment path, or the 
•	local app directory, the load fails. Depending on the operating system, you'll see an 
•	error message like this: 
•	One way to avoid this issue is to copy the DLL to the directory that contains your client 
•	executable as part of the build process. You can add a Post-Build Event to your project, 
•	to add a command that copies the DLL to your build output directory. The command 
•	specified here copies the DLL only if it's missing or has changed. It uses macros to copy 
•	to and from the Debug or Release locations, based on your build configuration. 
•	To copy the DLL in a post-build event 
•	1. Right-click on the MathClient node in Solution Explorer and choose Properties to 
•	open the Property Pages dialog.2. In the Configuration drop-down box, select All Configurations if it isn't already 
•	selected. 
•	3. In the left pane, select Configuration Properties > Build Events > Post-Build 
•	Event. 
•	4. In the property pane, select the edit control in the Command Line field. If you 
•	followed the directions to put your client project in a separate solution from the 
•	DLL project, then enter this command: 
•	xcopy /y /d "..\..\MathLibrary\$(IntDir)MathLibrary.dll" "$(OutDir)" 
•	If your DLL and client projects are in other directories, change the relative path to 
•	the DLL to match. 
•	5. Choose the OK button to save your changes to the project properties. 
•	Now your client app has everything it needs to build and run. Build the application by 
•	choosing Build > Build Solution on the menu bar. The Output window in Visual Studio 
•	should have something like the following example depending on your version of Visual 
•	Studio:

•	Congratulations, you've created an application that calls functions in your DLL. Now run 
•	your application to see what it does. On the menu bar, choose Debug > Start Without 
•	Debugging. Visual Studio opens a command window for the program to run in. The last

•	happens when you step into a library call. Add other functions to the library, or write 
•	another client app that uses your DLL. 
•	When you deploy your app, you must also deploy the DLLs it uses. The simplest way to

•	Article • 10/29/2021 
•	This step-by-step walkthrough shows how to create a static library (.lib file) for use with 
•	C++ apps. Using a static library is a great way to reuse code. Rather than 
•	reimplementing the same routines in every app that requires the functionality, you write 
•	them one time in a static library and then reference it from the apps. Code linked from a 
•	static library becomes part of your app—you don't have to install another file to use the 
•	code. 
•	This walkthrough covers these tasks: 
•	Create a static library project 
•	Add a class to the static library 
•	Create a C++ console app that references the static library 
•	Use the functionality from the static library in the app 
•	Run the app 
•	Prerequisites

•	In this 10-minute introduction to the code editor in Visual Studio, we'll add code to a file 
•	to look at some of the ways that Visual Studio makes writing, navigating, and 
•	understanding code easier. 
•	If you haven't already installed Visual Studio, go to the Visual Studio downloads page 
•	to install it for free. 
•	This article assumes you're already familiar with a programming language. If you aren't, 
•	we suggest you look at one of the programming quickstarts first, such as create a web

•	information, see GitHub Copilot FAQs . 
•	Get started with GitHub Copilot in Visual Studio. Note that it requires Visual Studio 2022 
•	version 17.8 or later. 
•	Use code snippetsVisual Studio provides useful code snippets that you can use to quickly and easily 
•	generate commonly used code blocks. Code snippets are available for different 
•	programming languages including C#, Visual Basic, and C++. 
•	Let's add the C# void Main snippet to our file. 
•	1. Place your cursor just above the final closing brace } in the file, and type the 
•	characters svm . 
•	A pop-up dialog box appears with information about the svm code snippet. 
•	2. Select the Tab key twice to insert the code snippet. 
•	You'll see the static void Main() method signature get added to the file. The 
•	Main() method is the entry point for C# applications. 
•	Available code snippets vary for different programming languages. You can look at the 
•	available code snippets for your language by choosing Edit > IntelliSense > Insert 
•	Snippet or by selecting the Ctrl+K, Ctrl+X keys, and then choosing the folder for your 
•	programming language. For C#, the snippet list looks like this:The list includes snippets for creating a class, a constructor, a for loop, an if or switch 
•	statement, and more. 
•	The Text Editor toolbar, which is the row of buttons under the menu bar in Visual Studio, 
•	helps make you more productive as you code. For example, you can toggle IntelliSense 
•	completion mode, increase or decrease a line indent, or comment out code that you 
•	don't want to compile. 
•	Let's comment out some code. 
•	1. Paste the following code into the Main() method body. 
•	C# 
•	Comment out code 
•	// someWords is a string array. 
•	string[] someWords = { 
•	"the", 
•	"quick", 
•	"brown", 
•	"fox", 
•	"jumps" 
•	};2. We're not using the moreWords variable, but we might use it later so we don't want 
•	to delete it. Instead, we'll comment out those lines. Select the entire definition of 
•	moreWords down to the closing semicolon, and then choose the Comment out the 
•	selected lines button on the Text Editor toolbar. If you prefer to use the keyboard, 
•	select Ctrl+K, Ctrl+C. 
•	The C# comment characters // are added to the beginning of each selected line 
•	to comment out the code. 
•	When you want to uncomment lines, you can select them, and then choose the 
•	Uncomment the selected lines button on the Text Editor toolbar. If you prefer to 
•	use the keyboard, select Ctrl+K, Ctrl+U. 
•	We don't want to see the empty constructor that was generated for Class1 , so to 
•	unclutter our view of the code, let's collapse it. Choose the small gray box with the 
•	minus sign inside it in the margin of the first line of the constructor. Or, if you prefer to 
•	use the keyboard, place the cursor anywhere in the constructor code and select the 
•	Ctrl+M, Ctrl+M keys. 
•	string[] moreWords = { 
•	"over", 
•	"the", 
•	"lazy", 
•	"dog" 
•	}; 
•	// Alphabetically sort the words. 
•	IEnumerable<string> query = from word in someWords 
•	orderby word 
•	select word; 
•	Collapse code blocksThe code block collapses to just the first line, followed by an ellipsis ( ... ). To expand 
•	the code block again, select the same gray box that now has a plus sign in it, or select 
•	Ctrl+M, Ctrl+M again. This feature is called Outlining and is especially useful when 
•	you're collapsing long methods or entire classes. 
•	View symbol definitions 
•	The Visual Studio editor makes it easy to inspect the definition of a type, method, or 
•	variable. One way is to go to the definition, in whichever file has it, by choosing Go to 
•	Definition or by selecting the F12 key anywhere a symbol is referenced. An even quicker 
•	way that doesn't move your focus away from the code you're working on is to use Peek 
•	Definition. 
•	Let's peek at the definition of the string type. 
•	1. Right-click on any occurrence of string and choose Peek Definition from the 
•	content menu. Or, select the Alt+F12 keys. 
•	A pop-up window appears with the definition of the String class. You can scroll 
•	within the pop-up window, or even peek at the definition of another type from the 
•	peeked code. 
•	2. Close the peek definition window by choosing the small box with an "x" at the top 
•	right of the pop-up window. 
•	Use IntelliSense to complete words 
•	IntelliSense is an invaluable resource when you're coding. It can show you information 
•	about available members of a type, or parameter details for different overloads of amethod. You can also use IntelliSense to complete a word after you type enough 
•	characters to disambiguate it. 
•	Let's add a line of code to print out the ordered strings to the console window, which is 
•	the standard place for output from the program to go. 
•	1. Below the query variable, start typing the following code: 
•	C# 
•	You'll see an IntelliSense pop-up appear with information about the query symbol. 
•	2. To insert the rest of the word query by using IntelliSense word completion, select 
•	the Tab key. 
•	3. Finish off the code block to look like the following code. You can practice further 
•	with code snippets by entering cw and then selecting Tab twice to generate the 
•	Console.WriteLine statement. 
•	C# 
•	Nobody gets code right the first time, and one of the things you might have to change 
•	is the name of a variable or method. Let's try out Visual Studio's refactor functionality to 
•	rename the someWords variable to unsortedWords . 
•	foreach (string str in qu 
•	foreach (string str in query) 
•	{ 
•	Console.WriteLine(str); 
•	} 
•	Refactor a name1. Place your cursor over the definition of the someWords variable, and choose 
•	Rename from the right-click or context menu, or select the F2 key. 
•	A Rename dialog box appears at the top right of the editor. 
•	2. Enter the desired name unsortedWords. You'll see that the reference to 
•	unsortedWords in the query assignment statement is also automatically renamed. 
•	Before you select the Enter key, select the Include comments checkbox in the 
•	Rename pop-up box. 
•	3. Select the Enter key. 
•	Both occurrences of someWords in your code have been renamed, as well as the 
•	text someWords in your code comment.

•	Visual Studio debugger 
•	Article • 01/12/2024 
•	The Visual Studio debugger provides many powerful features to help you debug your 
•	apps. This topic provides a quick way to learn some of the basic features. 
•	1. Open Visual Studio and create a project. 
•	Press Esc to close the start window. Type Ctrl + Q to open the search box, type 
•	c++, choose Templates, then choose Create new Console App project. In the 
•	dialog box that appears, choose Create. 
•	If you don't see the Windows Console Application project template, go to Tools > 
•	Get Tools and Features..., which opens the Visual Studio Installer. The Visual Studio 
•	Installer launches. Choose the Desktop development with C++ workload, then 
•	choose Modify. 
•	Visual Studio creates the project. 
•	2. In MyDbgApp.cpp, replace the following code 
•	C++ 
•	with this code (do not remove #include "stdafx.h" ): 
•	C++ 
•	Create a new project 
•	int main() 
•	{ 
•	return 0; 
•	} 
•	#include <list> 
•	#include <iostream> 
•	using namespace std; 
•	void doWork() 
•	{ 
•	list <int> c1;A breakpoint is a marker that indicates where Visual Studio should suspend your running 
•	code so you can take a look at the values of variables, or the behavior of memory, or 
•	whether or not a branch of code is getting run. It is the most basic feature in debugging. 
•	1. To set the breakpoint, click in the gutter to the left of the doWork function call (or 
•	select the line of code and press F9). 
•	2. Now press F5 (or choose Debug > Start Debugging). 
•	The debugger pauses where you set the breakpoint. The statement where the 
•	debugger and app execution is paused is indicated by the yellow arrow. The line 
•	with the doWork function call has not yet executed. 
•	c1.push_back(10); 
•	c1.push_back(20); 
•	const list <int> c2 = c1; 
•	const int &i = c2.front(); 
•	const int &j = c2.front(); 
•	cout << "The first element is " << i << endl; 
•	cout << "The second element is " << j << endl; 
•	} 
•	int main() 
•	{ 
•	doWork(); 
•	} 
•	Set a breakpoint 
•	 TipIf you have a breakpoint in a loop or recursion, or if you have many 
•	breakpoints that you frequently step through, use a conditional breakpoint to 
•	make sure that your code is suspended ONLY when specific conditions are 
•	met. A conditional breakpoint saves time and can also make it easier to debug 
•	issues that are hard to reproduce. 
•	When trying to debug memory-related failures in C++, you can also use 
•	breakpoints to inspect address values (look for NULL) and reference counts. 
•	Navigate code 
•	There are different commands to instruct the debugger to continue. We show a useful 
•	code navigation command that is available starting in Visual Studio 2017. 
•	While paused at the breakpoint, hover over the statement c1.push_back(20) until the 
•	green Run to click button appears, and then press the Run to click button. 
•	The app continues execution, calling doWork , and pauses on the line of code where you 
•	clicked the button. 
•	Common keyboard commands used to step through code include F10 and F11. For more 
•	in-depth instructions, see First look at the debugger. 
•	Inspect variables in a datatip 
•	1. In the current line of code (marked by the yellow execution pointer), hover over 
•	the c1 object with your mouse to show a datatip.The datatip shows you the current value of the c1 variable and allows you to 
•	inspect its properties. When debugging, if you see a value you don't expect, you 
•	probably have a bug in the preceding or calling lines of code. 
•	2. Expand the datatip to look at the current property values of the c1 object. 
•	3. If you want to pin the datatip so that you can continue to see the value of c1 while 
•	you execute code, click the small pin icon. (You can move the pinned datatip to a 
•	convenient location.) 
•	Edit code and continue debugging 
•	If you identify a change that you want to test in your code while in the middle of a 
•	debugging session, you can do that, too. 
•	1. Click the second instance of c2.front() and change c2.front() to c2.back() . 
•	2. Press F10 (or Debug > Step Over) a few times to advance the debugger and 
•	execute the edited code. 
•	F10 advances the debugger one statement at a time, but steps over functions 
•	instead of stepping into them (the code that you skip still executes). 
•	For more information on using edit-and-continue and on feature limitations, see Edit 
•	and Continue.Feedback

•	You can also use Copilot /tests slash command to generate unit tests from code. 
•	For example, you can type /tests using Boost framework to generate Boost.Test 
•	tests. For more information, see Use slash commands in Copilot Chat. 
•	Basic test workflow 
•	The following sections show the basic steps to get you started with C++ unit testing. 
•	The basic configuration is similar for both the Microsoft and Google Test frameworks. 
•	Boost.Test requires that you manually create a test project. 
•	Create a test project in Visual Studio 2022 
•	Define and run unit tests inside one or more test projects. A test project creates a 
•	separate app that calls the code in your executable and reports on its behavior. Create 
•	test projects in the same solution as the code you want to test. 
•	To add a new test project to an existing solution: 
•	1. Right-click on the Solution node in Solution Explorer. 
•	2. In the context menu, choose Add > New Project. 
•	3. Set Language to C++ and type test in the search box. The following screenshot 
•	shows the test projects that are available when the Desktop Development with 
•	C++ and the UWP Development workload are installed:Create references to other projects in the solution 
•	To enable access to the functions in the project under test, add a reference to the 
•	project in your test project. In Solution Explorer, expand your test project. Right-click 
•	References and then select Add > Reference. In the Add Reference dialog box, choose 
•	the projects you want to test.Link to object or library files 
•	If the test code doesn't export the functions that you want to test, add the output .obj 
•	or .lib files to the dependencies of the test project. For more information, see To link 
•	the tests to the object or library files. Don't include object files that have a main function 
•	or another standard entry point such as wmain , WinMain , or DllMain . When you add new 
•	source files to your project, update the test project dependencies to include the 
•	corresponding object files. 
•	Add #include directives for header files 
•	In your unit test .cpp file, add an #include directive for any header files that declare the 
•	types and functions you want to test. Type #include " , and then IntelliSense activates to 
•	help you choose. Repeat for any more headers. Tip 
•	To avoid having to type the full path in each include statement in the source file, 
•	add the required folders in Project > Properties > C/C++ > General > Additional 
•	Include Directories.

•	Program on the Command Line 
•	Article • 02/08/2022 
•	Visual Studio includes a command-line C and C++ compiler. You can use it to create 
•	everything from basic console apps to Universal Windows Platform apps, Desktop apps, 
•	device drivers, and .NET components. 
•	In this walkthrough, you create a basic, "Hello, World"-style C++ program by using a 
•	text editor, and then compile it on the command line. If you'd like to try the Visual 
•	Studio IDE instead of using the command line, see Walkthrough: Working with Projects 
•	and Solutions (C++) or Using the Visual Studio IDE for C++ Desktop Development. 
•	In this walkthrough, you can use your own C++ program instead of typing the one 
•	that's shown. Or, you can use a C++ code sample from another help article. 
•	Prerequisites 
•	To complete this walkthrough, you must have installed either Visual Studio and the 
•	optional Desktop development with C++ workload, or the command-line Build Tools 
•	for Visual Studio. 
•	Visual Studio is an integrated development environment (IDE). It supports a full-featured 
•	editor, resource managers, debuggers, and compilers for many languages and 
•	platforms. Versions available include the free Visual Studio Community edition, and all 
•	can support C and C++ development. For information on how to download and install 
•	Visual Studio, see Install C++ support in Visual Studio. 
•	The Build Tools for Visual Studio installs only the command-line compilers, tools, and 
•	libraries you need to build C and C++ programs. It's perfect for build labs or classroom 
•	exercises and installs relatively quickly. To install only the command-line tools, look for 
•	Build Tools for Visual Studio on the Visual Studio Downloads page. 
•	Before you can build a C or C++ program on the command line, verify that the tools are 
•	installed, and you can access them from the command line. Visual C++ has complex 
•	requirements for the command-line environment to find the tools, headers, and libraries 
•	it uses. You can't use Visual C++ in a plain command prompt window without doing 
•	some preparation. Fortunately, Visual C++ installs shortcuts for you to launch a 
•	developer command prompt that has the environment set up for command line builds. 
•	Unfortunately, the names of the developer command prompt shortcuts and wherethey're located are different in almost every version of Visual C++ and on different 
•	versions of Windows. Your first walkthrough task is finding the right one to use. 
•	７ Note 
•	A developer command prompt shortcut automatically sets the correct paths for the 
•	compiler and tools, and for any required headers and libraries. You must set these 
•	environment values yourself if you use a regular Command Prompt window. For 
•	more information, see Use the MSVC toolset from the command line. We 
•	recommend you use a developer command prompt shortcut instead of building 
•	your own. 
•	Open a developer command prompt 
•	1. If you have installed Visual Studio 2017 or later on Windows 10 or later, open the 
•	Start menu and choose All apps. Scroll down and open the Visual Studio folder 
•	(not the Visual Studio application). Choose Developer Command Prompt for VS to 
•	open the command prompt window. 
•	If you have installed Microsoft Visual C++ Build Tools 2015 on Windows 10 or 
•	later, open the Start menu and choose All apps. Scroll down and open the Visual 
•	C++ Build Tools folder. Choose Visual C++ 2015 x86 Native Tools Command 
•	Prompt to open the command prompt window. 
•	You can also use the Windows search function to search for "developer command 
•	prompt" and choose one that matches your installed version of Visual Studio. Use 
•	the shortcut to open the command prompt window. 
•	2. Next, verify that the Visual C++ developer command prompt is set up correctly. In 
•	the command prompt window, enter cl and verify that the output looks 
•	something like this: 
•	Output 
•	C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2017\Enterprise>cl 
•	Microsoft (R) C/C++ Optimizing Compiler Version 19.10.25017 for x86 
•	Copyright (C) Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved. 
•	usage: cl [ option... ] filename... [ /link linkoption... ] 
•	There may be differences in the current directory or version numbers. These values 
•	depend on the version of Visual C++ and any updates installed. If the aboveoutput is similar to what you see, then you're ready to build C or C++ programs at 
•	the command line. 
•	７ Note 
•	If you get an error such as "'cl' is not recognized as an internal or external 
•	command, operable program or batch file," error C1034, or error LNK1104 
•	when you run the cl command, then either you are not using a developer 
•	command prompt, or something is wrong with your installation of Visual C++. 
•	You must fix this issue before you can continue. 
•	If you can't find the developer command prompt shortcut, or if you get an error 
•	message when you enter cl , then your Visual C++ installation may have a 
•	problem. Try reinstalling the Visual C++ component in Visual Studio, or reinstall 
•	the Microsoft Visual C++ Build Tools. Don't go on to the next section until the cl 
•	command works. For more information about installing and troubleshooting Visual 
•	C++, see Install Visual Studio. 
•	７ Note 
•	Depending on the version of Windows on the computer and the system 
•	security configuration, you might have to right-click to open the shortcut 
•	menu for the developer command prompt shortcut and then choose Run as 
•	administrator to successfully build and run the program that you create by 
•	following this walkthrough. 
•	Create a Visual C++ source file and compile it on the 
•	command line 
•	1. In the developer command prompt window, enter md c:\hello to create a 
•	directory, and then enter cd c:\hello to change to that directory. This directory is 
•	where both your source file and the compiled program get created. 
•	2. Enter notepad hello.cpp in the command prompt window. 
•	Choose Yes when Notepad prompts you to create a new file. This step opens a 
•	blank Notepad window, ready for you to enter your code in a file named hello.cpp. 
•	3. In Notepad, enter the following lines of code:C++ 
•	This code is a simple program that will write one line of text on the screen and 
•	then exit. To minimize errors, copy this code and paste it into Notepad. 
•	4. Save your work! In Notepad, on the File menu, choose Save. 
•	Congratulations, you've created a C++ source file, hello.cpp, that is ready to 
•	compile. 
•	5. Switch back to the developer command prompt window. Enter dir at the 
•	command prompt to list the contents of the c:\hello directory. You should see the 
•	source file hello.cpp in the directory listing, which looks something like: 
•	Output 
•	The dates and other details will differ on your computer. 
•	#include <iostream> 
•	using namespace std; 
•	int main() 
•	{ 
•	cout << "Hello, world, from Visual C++!" << endl; 
•	} 
•	c:\hello>dir 
•	Volume in drive C has no label. 
•	Volume Serial Number is CC62-6545 
•	Directory of c:\hello 
•	05/24/2016 05:36 PM <DIR> . 
•	05/24/2016 05:36 PM <DIR> .. 
•	05/24/2016 05:37 PM 115 hello.cpp 
•	1 File(s) 115 bytes 
•	2 Dir(s) 571,343,446,016 bytes free 
•	７ Note 
•	If you don't see your source code file, hello.cpp , make sure the current 
•	working directory in your command prompt is the C:\hello directory you 
•	created. Also make sure that this is the directory where you saved your source 
•	file. And make sure that you saved the source code with a .cpp file name 
•	extension, not a .txt extension. Your source file gets saved in the current 
•	directory as a .cpp file automatically if you open Notepad at the commandprompt by using the notepad hello.cpp command. Notepad's behavior is 
•	different if you open it another way: By default, Notepad appends a .txt 
•	extension to new files when you save them. It also defaults to saving files in 
•	your Documents directory. To save your file with a .cpp extension in Notepad, 
•	choose File > Save As. In the Save As dialog, navigate to your C:\hello folder 
•	in the directory tree view control. Then use the Save as type dropdown 
•	control to select All Files (*.*). Enter hello.cpp in the File name edit control, 
•	and then choose Save to save the file. 
•	6. At the developer command prompt, enter cl /EHsc hello.cpp to compile your 
•	program. 
•	The cl.exe compiler generates an .obj file that contains the compiled code, and 
•	then runs the linker to create an executable program named hello.exe. This name 
•	appears in the lines of output information that the compiler displays. The output of 
•	the compiler should look something like: 
•	Output 
•	c:\hello>cl /EHsc hello.cpp 
•	Microsoft (R) C/C++ Optimizing Compiler Version 19.10.25017 for x86 
•	Copyright (C) Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved. 
•	hello.cpp 
•	Microsoft (R) Incremental Linker Version 14.10.25017.0 
•	Copyright (C) Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved. 
•	/out:hello.exe 
•	hello.obj 
•	７ Note 
•	If you get an error such as "'cl' is not recognized as an internal or external 
•	command, operable program or batch file," error C1034, or error LNK1104, 
•	your developer command prompt is not set up correctly. For information on 
•	how to fix this issue, go back to the Open a developer command prompt 
•	section. 
•	７ Note 
•	If you get a different compiler or linker error or warning, review your source 
•	code to correct any errors, then save it and run the compiler again. Forinformation about specific errors, use the search box to look for the error 
•	number. 
•	7. To run the hello.exe program, at the command prompt, enter hello . 
•	The program displays this text and exits: 
•	Output 
•	Hello, world, from Visual C++! 
•	Congratulations, you've compiled and run a C++ program by using the command 
•	line tools. 
•	Next steps 
•	This "Hello, World" example is about as simple as a C++ program can get. Real world 
•	programs usually have header files, more source files, and link to libraries. 
•	You can use the steps in this walkthrough to build your own C++ code instead of typing 
•	the sample code shown. These steps also let you build many C++ code sample 
•	programs that you find elsewhere. You can put your source code and build your apps in 
•	any writeable directory. By default, the Visual Studio IDE creates projects in your user 
•	folder, in a source\repos subfolder. Older versions may put projects in a 
•	Documents\Visual Studio <version>\Projects folder. 
•	To compile a program that has additional source code files, enter them all on the 
•	command line, like: 
•	cl /EHsc file1.cpp file2.cpp file3.cpp 
•	The /EHsc command-line option instructs the compiler to enable standard C++ 
•	exception handling behavior. Without it, thrown exceptions can result in undestroyed 
•	objects and resource leaks. For more information, see /EH (Exception Handling Model). 
•	When you supply additional source files, the compiler uses the first input file to create 
•	the program name. In this case, it outputs a program called file1.exe. To change the 
•	name to program1.exe, add an /out linker option: 
•	cl /EHsc file1.cpp file2.cpp file3.cpp /link /out:program1.exe 
•	And to catch more programming mistakes automatically, we recommend you compile 
•	by using either the /W3 or /W4 warning level option:cl /W4 /EHsc file1.cpp file2.cpp file3.cpp /link /out:program1.exe 
•	The compiler, cl.exe, has many more options. You can apply them to build, optimize, 
•	debug, and analyze your code. For a quick list, enter cl /? at the developer command 
•	prompt. You can also compile and link separately and apply linker options in more 
•	complex build scenarios. For more information on compiler and linker options and 
•	usage, see C/C++ Building Reference. 
•	You can use NMAKE and makefiles, MSBuild and project files, or CMake, to configure 
•	and build more complex projects on the command line. For more information on using 
•	these tools, see NMAKE Reference, MSBuild, and CMake projects in Visual Studio. 
•	The C and C++ languages are similar, but not the same. The MSVC compiler uses a 
•	simple rule to determine which language to use when it compiles your code. By default, 
•	the MSVC compiler treats files that end in .c as C source code, and files that end in 
•	.cpp as C++ source code. To force the compiler to treat all files as C++ independent of 
•	file name extension, use the /TP compiler option. 
•	The MSVC compiler includes a C Runtime Library (CRT) that conforms to the ISO C99 
•	standard, with minor exceptions. Portable code generally compiles and runs as expected. 
•	Certain obsolete library functions, and several POSIX function names, are deprecated by 
•	the MSVC compiler. The functions are supported, but the preferred names have 
•	changed. For more information, see Security Features in the CRT and Compiler Warning 
•	(level 3) C4996.

C++ Standard Library reference (STL)
•	Article
•	08/17/2022 
•	
A C++ program can call on a large number of functions from this conforming implementation of the C++ Standard Library. These functions perform services such as input and output and provide efficient implementations of frequently used operations.
For more information about linking with the appropriate Visual C++ runtime .lib file, see C runtime (CRT) and C++ Standard Library (STL) .lib files.
Note
Microsoft's implementation of the C++ Standard Library is often referred to as the STL or Standard Template Library. Although C++ Standard Library is the official name of the library as defined in ISO 14882, due to the popular use of "STL" and "Standard Template Library" in search engines, we occasionally use those names to make it easier to find our documentation.
From a historical perspective, "STL" originally referred to the Standard Template Library written by Alexander Stepanov. Parts of that library were standardized in the C++ Standard Library, along with the ISO C runtime library, parts of the Boost library, and other functionality. Sometimes "STL" is used to refer to the containers and algorithms parts of the C++ Standard Library adapted from Stepanov's STL. In this documentation, Standard Template Library (STL) refers to the C++ Standard Library as a whole.

3.	Path and environment variables for command-line builds 
4.	Developer command prompt shortcuts 
You can build C and C++ applications on the command line by using tools that are included in Visual Studio. The Microsoft C++ (MSVC) compiler toolset is also downloadable as a standalone package. You don't need to install the Visual Studio IDE if you don't plan to use it.
Note
This article is about how to set up an environment to use the individual compilers, linkers, librarian, and other basic tools. The native project build system in Visual Studio, based on MSBuild, doesn't use the environment as described in this article. For more information on how to use MSBuild from the command line, see MSBuild on the command line - C++.
Download and install the tools
If you've installed Visual Studio and a C++ workload, you have all the command-line tools. For information on how to install C++ and Visual Studio, see Install C++ support in Visual Studio. If you only want the command-line toolset, download the Build Tools for Visual Studio. When you run the downloaded executable, it updates and runs the Visual Studio Installer. To install only the tools you need for C++ development, select the Desktop development with C++ workload. You can select optional libraries and toolsets to include under Installation details. To build code by using the Visual Studio 2015, 2017, or 2019 toolsets, select the optional MSVC v140, v141, or v142 build tools. When you're satisfied with your selections, choose Install.
How to use the command-line tools
When you choose one of the C++ workloads in the Visual Studio Installer, it installs the Visual Studio platform toolset. A platform toolset has all the C and C++ tools for a specific Visual Studio version. The tools include the C/C++ compilers, linkers, assemblers, and other build tools, and matching libraries and header files. You can use all of these tools at the command line. They're also used internally by the Visual Studio IDE. There are separate x86-hosted and x64-hosted compilers and tools to build code for x86, x64, ARM, and ARM64 targets. Each set of tools for a particular host and target build architecture is stored in its own directory.
To work correctly, the tools require several specific environment variables to be set. These variables are used to add the tools to the path, and to set the locations of include files, library files, and SDKs. To make it easy to set these environment variables, the installer creates customized command files, or batch files, during installation. You can run one of these command files to set a specific host and target build architecture, Windows SDK version, and platform toolset. For convenience, the installer also creates shortcuts in your Start menu. The shortcuts open developer command prompt windows by using these command files for specific combinations of host and target. These shortcuts ensure all the required environment variables are set and ready to use.
The required environment variables are specific to your installation and to the build architecture you choose. They also might be changed by product updates or upgrades. This variability is one reason why we recommend you use an installed command prompt shortcut or command file, instead of setting the environment variables yourself.
The toolsets, command files, and shortcuts installed depend on your computer processor and the options you selected during installation. The x86-hosted tools and cross tools that build x86 and x64 code are always installed. If you have 64-bit Windows, the x64-hosted tools and cross tools that build x86 and x64 code are also installed. If you choose the optional C++ Universal Windows Platform tools, then the x86 and x64 tools that build ARM and ARM64 code also get installed. Other workloads may install these and other tools.
Path and environment variables for command-line builds
The MSVC command-line tools use the PATH, TMP, INCLUDE, LIB, and LIBPATH environment variables, and also use other environment variables specific to your installed tools, platforms, and SDKs. Even a simple Visual Studio installation may set twenty or more environment variables. This complexity is why we strongly recommend that you use a developer command prompt shortcut or one of the customized command files. We don't recommend you set these variables in the Windows environment yourself.
To see which environment variables are set by a developer command prompt shortcut, you can use the SET command. Open a plain command prompt window and capture the output of the SET command for a baseline. Open a developer command prompt window and capture the output of the SET command for comparison. Use a diff tool such as the one built into Visual Studio to highlight the environment variables set by the developer command prompt. For more information about the compiler and linker environment variables, see CL environment variables.
Developer command prompt shortcuts
The command prompt shortcuts are installed in a version-specific Visual Studio folder in your Windows Start menu. Here's a list of the base command prompt shortcuts and the build architectures they support:
•	Developer Command Prompt - Sets the environment to use 32-bit, x86-native tools to build 32-bit, x86-native code.
•	x86 Native Tools Command Prompt - Sets the environment to use 32-bit, x86-native tools to build 32-bit, x86-native code.
•	x64 Native Tools Command Prompt - Sets the environment to use 64-bit, x64-native tools to build 64-bit, x64-native code.
•	x86_x64 Cross Tools Command Prompt - Sets the environment to use 32-bit, x86-native tools to build 64-bit, x64-native code.
•	x64_x86 Cross Tools Command Prompt - Sets the environment to use 64-bit, x64-native tools to build 32-bit, x86-native code.
The Start menu folder and shortcut names vary depending on the installed version of Visual Studio. If you set one, they also depend on the installation Nickname. For example, suppose you installed Visual Studio 2022, and you gave it a nickname of Latest. The developer command prompt shortcut is named Developer Command Prompt for VS 2022 (Latest), in a folder named Visual Studio 2022.
Note
Several command-line tools or tool options may require Administrator permission. If you have permission issues when you use them, we recommend that you open the developer command prompt window by using the Run as Administrator option. Right-click to open the shortcut menu for the command prompt window, then choose More, Run as administrator.
To open a developer command prompt window
1.	On the desktop, open the Windows Start menu. In Windows 11, choose the All apps button to open the list of installed apps. In Windows 10, the list is open to the left. Scroll down the list to find and open the folder (not the app) for your version of Visual Studio, for example, Visual Studio 2022.
2.	In the folder, choose the Developer Command Prompt for your version of Visual Studio. This shortcut starts a developer command prompt window that uses the default build architecture of 32-bit, x86-native tools to build 32-bit, x86-native code. If you prefer a non-default build architecture, choose one of the native or cross tools command prompts to specify the host and target architecture.
For an even faster way to open a developer command prompt, enter developer command prompt in the desktop search box. Then choose the result you want.
Note
By default, the current working directory in a developer command prompt is the root of your Visual Studio installation in the Program Files directory. This isn't an appropriate location for your code and projects. Change the current working directory to another location before you create a project. The IDE creates projects in your user directory, typically in %USERPROFILE%\source\repos.
Developer command file locations
If you prefer to set the build environment in an existing command prompt window, you can use one of the command files created by the installer. We recommend you set the environment in a new command prompt window. We don't recommend you later switch environments in the same command window.
The command file location depends on the version of Visual Studio you installed, and on choices you made during installation. For Visual Studio 2019, the typical installation location on a 64-bit system is in \Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\<edition>. The <edition> may be Community, Professional, Enterprise, BuildTools, or another nickname you supplied.
The primary developer command prompt command file, VsDevCmd.bat, is located in the Common7\Tools subdirectory. When no parameters are specified, it sets the environment to use the x86-native tools to build 32-bit x86 code.
More command files are available to set up specific build architectures. The command files available depend on the Visual Studio workloads and options you've installed. In Visual Studio 2017 and Visual Studio 2019, you'll find them in the VC\Auxiliary\Build subdirectory.
These command files set default parameters and call VsDevCmd.bat to set up the specified build architecture environment. A typical installation may include these command files:
Command File	Host and Target architectures
vcvars32.bat	Use the 32-bit x86-native tools to build 32-bit x86 code.
vcvars64.bat	Use the 64-bit x64-native tools to build 64-bit x64 code.
vcvarsx86_amd64.bat	Use the 32-bit x86-native cross tools to build 64-bit x64 code.
vcvarsamd64_x86.bat	Use the 64-bit x64-native cross tools to build 32-bit x86 code.
vcvarsx86_arm.bat	Use the 32-bit x86-native cross tools to build ARM code.
vcvarsamd64_arm.bat	Use the 64-bit x64-native cross tools to build ARM code.
vcvarsx86_arm64.bat	Use the 32-bit x86-native cross tools to build ARM64 code.
vcvarsamd64_arm64.bat	Use the 64-bit x64-native cross tools to build ARM64 code.
vcvarsall.bat	Use parameters to specify the host and target architectures, Windows SDK, and platform choices. For a list of supported options, call by using a /help parameter.
Caution
The vcvarsall.bat file and other Visual Studio command files can vary from computer to computer. Do not replace a missing or damaged vcvarsall.bat file by using a file from another computer. Rerun the Visual Studio installer to replace the missing file.
The vcvarsall.bat file also varies from version to version. If the current version of Visual Studio is installed on a computer that also has an earlier version of Visual Studio, do not run vcvarsall.bat or another Visual Studio command file from different versions in the same command prompt window.
Use the developer tools in an existing command window
The simplest way to specify a particular build architecture in an existing command window is to use the vcvarsall.bat file. Use vcvarsall.bat to set environment variables to configure the command line for native 32-bit or 64-bit compilation. Arguments let you specify cross-compilation to x86, x64, ARM, or ARM64 processors. You can target Microsoft Store, Universal Windows Platform, or Windows Desktop platforms. You can even specify which Windows SDK to use, and select the platform toolset version.
When used with no arguments, vcvarsall.bat configures the environment variables to use the current x86-native compiler for 32-bit Windows Desktop targets. You can add arguments to configure the environment to use any of the native or cross compiler tools. vcvarsall.bat displays an error message if you specify a configuration that's not installed, or not available on your computer.
vcvarsall syntax
vcvarsall.bat [architecture] [platform_type] [winsdk_version] [-vcvars_ver=vcversion] [spectre_mode]
architecture
This optional argument specifies the host and target architecture to use. If architecture isn't specified, the default build environment is used. These arguments are supported:
architecture	Compiler	Host computer architecture	Build output (target) architecture
x86	x86 32-bit native	x86, x64	x86
x86_amd64 or x86_x64	x64 on x86 cross	x86, x64	x64
x86_arm	ARM on x86 cross	x86, x64	ARM
x86_arm64	ARM64 on x86 cross	x86, x64	ARM64
amd64 or x64	x64 64-bit native	x64	x64
amd64_x86 or x64_x86	x86 on x64 cross	x64	x86
amd64_arm or x64_arm	ARM on x64 cross	x64	ARM
amd64_arm64 or x64_arm64	ARM64 on x64 cross	x64	ARM64
platform_type
This optional argument allows you to specify store or uwp as the platform type. By default, the environment is set to build desktop or console apps.
winsdk_version
Optionally specifies the version of the Windows SDK to use. By default, the latest installed Windows SDK is used. To specify the Windows SDK version, you can use a full Windows SDK number such as 10.0.10240.0, or specify 8.1 to use the Windows 8.1 SDK.
vcversion
Optionally specifies the Visual Studio compiler toolset to use. By default, the environment is set to use the current Visual Studio compiler toolset.
Use -vcvars_ver=14.2x.yyyyy to specify a specific version of the Visual Studio 2019 compiler toolset.
Use -vcvars_ver=14.29 to specify the latest version of the Visual Studio 2019 compiler toolset.
Use -vcvars_ver=14.0 to specify the Visual Studio 2015 compiler toolset.
spectre_mode
Leave this parameter out to use libraries without Spectre mitigations. Use the value spectre to use libraries with Spectre mitigations.
To set up the build environment in an existing command prompt window
1.	At the command prompt, use the CD command to change to the Visual Studio installation directory. Then, use CD again to change to the subdirectory that contains the configuration-specific command files. For Visual Studio 2019 and Visual Studio 2017, use the VC\Auxiliary\Build subdirectory. For Visual Studio 2015, use the VC subdirectory.
2.	Enter the command for your preferred developer environment. For example, to build ARM code for UWP on a 64-bit platform, using the latest Windows SDK and Visual Studio compiler toolset, use this command line:
vcvarsall.bat amd64_arm uwp
Create your own command prompt shortcut
Open the Properties dialog for a developer command prompt shortcut to see the command target used. For example, the target for the x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS 2019 shortcut is something similar to:
%comspec% /k "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2019\Community\VC\Auxiliary\Build\vcvars64.bat"
The architecture-specific batch files set the architecture parameter and call vcvarsall.bat. You can pass the same options to these batch files as you would pass to vcvarsall.bat, or you can just call vcvarsall.bat directly. To specify parameters for your own command shortcut, add them to the end of the command in double-quotes. For example, here's a shortcut to build ARM code for UWP on a 64-bit platform, using the latest Windows SDK. To use an earlier compiler toolset, specify the version number. Use something like this command target in your shortcut:
%comspec% /k "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2019\Community\VC\Auxiliary\Build\vcvarsall.bat" amd64_arm uwp -vcvars_ver=14.29
Adjust the path to reflect your Visual Studio installation directory. The vcvarsall.bat file has additional information about specific version numbers.
Command-line tools
To build a C/C++ project at a command prompt, Visual Studio provides these command-line tools:
CL
Use the compiler (cl.exe) to compile and link source code files into apps, libraries, and DLLs.
Link
Use the linker (link.exe) to link compiled object files and libraries into apps and DLLs.
When you build on the command line, the F1 command isn't available for instant help. Instead, you can use a search engine to get information about warnings, errors, and messages. You can also download and use the offline help files. To use the search in Microsoft Learn, enter your query in the search box at the top of any article.
Command-line project management tools
By default, the Visual Studio IDE uses native project build systems based on MSBuild. You can invoke MSBuild directly to build projects without using the IDE. You can also use the devenv command to use Visual Studio to build projects and solutions. Visual Studio also supports build systems based on CMake or NMake.
MSBuild
Use MSBuild (msbuild.exe) and a project file (.vcxproj) to configure a build and invoke the toolset without loading the Visual Studio IDE. It's equivalent to running the Build project or Build Solution command in the Visual Studio IDE. MSBuild has advantages over the IDE when you build at the command line. You don't have to install the full IDE on all your build servers and build pipelines. You avoid the extra overhead of the IDE. MSBuild runs in containerized build environments, and supports a binary logger.
DEVENV
Use DEVENV (devenv.exe) combined with a command-line switch such as /Build or /Clean to execute certain build commands without displaying the Visual Studio IDE.
CMake
CMake (cmake.exe) is a cross-platform, open-source tool for defining build processes that run on multiple platforms. CMake can configure and control native build tools for its supported platforms, such as MSBuild and Make. For more information about CMake, see the CMake documentation.
NMAKE
Use NMAKE (nmake.exe) to build C++ projects by using a traditional makefile.
Note
Starting in Visual Studio 2019 version 16.5, MSBuild and DEVENV don't use the command-line environment to control the toolset and libraries used.

Abstract—Memory safety violations in low-level code, written
in languages like C, continues to remain one of the major
sources of software vulnerabilities. One method of removing
such violations by construction is to port C code to a safe C
dialect. Such dialects rely on programmer-supplied annotations
to guarantee safety with minimal runtime overhead. This porting,
however, is a manual process that imposes significant burden on
the programmer and, hence, there has been limited adoption of
this technique.
The task of porting not only requires inferring annotations,
but may also need refactoring/rewriting of the code to make
it amenable to such annotations. In this paper, we use Large
Language Models (LLMs) towards addressing both these con￾cerns. We show how to harness LLM capabilities to do complex
code reasoning as well as rewriting of large codebases. We also
present a novel framework for whole-program transformations
that leverages lightweight static analysis to break the transfor￾mation into smaller steps that can be carried out effectively by
an LLM. We implement our ideas in a tool called MSA that
targets the CheckedC dialect. We evaluate MSA on several micro￾benchmarks, as well as real-world code ranging up to 20K lines of
code. We showcase superior performance compared to a vanilla
LLM baseline, as well as demonstrate improvement over a state￾of-the-art symbolic (non-LLM) technique.
I. INTRODUCTION
Legacy C-programs are pervasive, which makes mem￾ory corruption vulnerabilities a major problem for software
systems. This problem has attracted a wealth of attention
for decades but memory safety violations continue to re￾main one of the major sources of cyber attacks. From
memorysafety.org: “Microsoft estimates that 70% of all
vulnerabilities in their products over the last decade have
been memory safety issues. Google estimated that 90% of
Android vulnerabilities in the wild are memory safety issues.
An analysis found that more than 80% of the exploited
vulnerabilities were memory safety issues.”
Researchers have proposed safe dialects of C, such as
Checked-C [1], Deputy [2], Cyclone [3], etc. These all use
static analysis and lightweight runtime checks to ensure formal
memory safety guarantees at low runtime overheads. However,
these techniques require source-level annotations. The manual
cost of adding these annotations, along with the code rewriting
that enable such annotations in the first place, are the main
hurdle for adoption of these dialects.
Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown
promise in improving the productivity of software developers
[4]. LLMs are highly versatile and accomplish diverse tasks
surprisingly well, given the right instructions as prompts.
Motivated by their novel capabilities, we present MSA, a
tool that leverages LLMs to help port C to Checked-C. We
are unaware of any prior LLM or Machine Learning based
approach for this task. Although recent symbolic analyses have
shown promising results [5], our evaluation shows that they
miss out on many annotations and do not perform refactoring.
Our main contribution is a novel framework that tightly
couples LLMs and symbolic representations. We show a
general recipe of breaking whole program transformations
into smaller tasks that can fit into LLM prompts, where each
task has a code snippet and a symbolic context that contains
relevant information about the other parts of the program that
are not included in the snippet (Section IV). MSA works in
multiple phases, where each phase is an instantiation of this
recipe for a different task. We present the prompts that we
used for each phase (Section V).
LLMs help compensate for shortcomings in symbolic in￾ference techniques by dealing with complex code patterns,
as well as performing refactoring where needed to allow for
further annotations in the code. For instance, if a procedure
signature is modified, then the effects have to be propagated
to its caller, possibly transitively. Our evaluation shows that
LLMs are able to accomplish this task well when provided
a sufficiently detailed prompt. On the other hand, LLMs can
hallucinate, thus, using symbolic information where available
helps improve overall accuracy. Finally, note that any anno￾tations generated by our tool are checked by the Checked C
compiler. Hence, even if the LLM falters and generates an
incorrect annotation, memory safety is not compromised—the
Checked C compiler will either give a compilation error or
instrument the code with a check that will fail at runtime. The
higher the accuracy of MSA, the less is the amount of time
developers have to spend porting to Checked C.
Although this paper focuses on memory safety, we believe
our contributions have wider ramifications in formal veri￾fication of real-world software. At a high level, any such
verification task requires three steps. First step is to rewrite
the code so that it is amenable to verification. Second step is
to annotate the code with contracts (invariants, type qualifiers,
etc.). The third and final step is to check that the code
satisfies the contracts, usually with an automated verifier.
These steps are interconnected, and any failure in the third
step has to be fixed by repeating the first two. While symbolic
techniques have been devised towards the second step, for
inferring contracts, the first step has generally not received
much attention. Given that LLMs have shown great promise in
tedious programming tasks, it is a natural research direction to
explore whether they can help with the first two steps, leaving
the third untouched in order to avoid compromising soundness.
Our work answers this question in the affirmative for the task
of memory safety of C.
To summarize, we make the following contributions:
• We present MSA, the first LLM-based assistant for porting
C to Checked-C. MSA performs transformations that are
out-of-reach of existing (symbolic-only) assistants.
• We present a novel recipe for breaking a whole program
transformation into smaller tasks that can fit into LLM
prompts.
• We evaluate MSA on real world C-programs, ranging up
to 20K lines of code, showing that it can successfully
infer 86% of the required annotations correctly.
We plan to open-source the implementation of MSA, along
with all the prompt templates that it uses.1 The rest of this
paper is organized as follows. Section II provides a back￾ground on Checked C, followed by examples that illustrate
the challenges of the porting process from C code. Section III
provides background on the state-of-the-art symbolic tool for
Checked C inference. Our technical contributions follow next.
We provide our generic recipe for whole program transfor￾mations using LLMs (Section IV) and then we show how
MSA instantiates this recipe to overcomes the challenges in the
porting process (Section V). We evaluate MSA (Section VI),
discuss threats to validity (Section VII), and survey related
work (Section VIII).
II. CHALLENGES IN PORTING C TO CHECKED C
Checked C is a safe dialect of C, inspired from Deputy
[2] and Cyclone [3]. It differs from its predecessors in that
it allows checked and unchecked code to coexist. Checked
regions guarantee spatial memory safety, i.e, any illegal out
of bounds memory access is caught and the program is termi￾nated. More precisely, Checked C satisfies a blame property
where any illegal access can be blamed on the unchecked parts
of the code [1].
Checked Pointer Types: Checked C introduces three
checked pointer types, namely, ptr<T>, arr<T> and
nt_arr<T> in place of the C pointer type T*. (These
names are abbreviated from their actual names, _Ptr<T>,
_Array_ptr<T> and _Nt_Array_ptr<T> for brevity.)
The ptr type is used for pointers that point to a single
object (or null) and are not involved in pointer arithmetic.
The compiler inserts a null check at every dereference of a
ptr type for spatial safety.
The arr type is used for pointers that point to an array of
values. It is accompanied by a bounds expression that specifies
the range of memory that the pointer can access. These decla￾rations appear as arr<T> p : bounds(lo, hi) where
lo and hi are expressions that evaluate to the lower and upper
bounds of the array, respectively. In addition to the null check,
a bounds check of lo <= (p+i) && (p+i) < hi is
also inserted at every dereference *(p+i) for an arr.
1See https://aka.ms/checkedc-annotation-inference.
There are other shorthand annotations, such as count(n)
or byte_count(n) that specify the number of elements
or bytes that the pointer can access, starting from its current
value. These checks are inserted at higher-level passes of the
compiler, and may get optimized away by lower-level passes in
the compiler if it manages to prove that accesses are within the
supplied bounds. This combination of type-assistance and low￾level optimizations makes the Checked C approach appealing
compared to other safe C approaches; portions of the FreeBSD
kernel that were ported to Checked C reported essentially no
runtime overhead [6].
The nt_arr type is used for pointers that point to
null-terminated arrays, mostly strings. An annotation of
count(n) implies that the array has at least n+ 1 elements,
the last being the null value. An interesting feature of nt_arr
is that its bounds can be widened until a null character is
found. Hence, while(*p != 0) p++; is a valid way to
access nt_arr<T> p:count(0). Each time *p does not
equal the null character, its bound can be widened by 1.
Challenges: Next, we explain some of the challenges in
porting C to Checked C through examples. In the changelogs
below, the C-code in red needs to be replaced with code in
green for a successful port. The examples in this section are
derived from real world C programs used in our evaluation,
and they are beyond the capabilities of existing inference tools
(Section III).
The first challenge is in handling nested pointers. Given a
nested pointer, e.g., long** pt, it is not possible in Checked
C to separately annotate the buffers pt[0], pt[1], etc., with
their sizes. The idiomatic way to handle this situation is to
replace the nested pointer with an array of structs, where the
struct has a buffer with its associated length. Correspondingly,
every access to pt throughout the program must be modified
to respect this new interface. A real-world example follows:
void AllocAssign(void) {
ulong net; ulong n = channelNets+1;
costMatrix =
- (long**) malloc(n * sizeof(long *));
+ (arr<struct arr_of_long>)
+ malloc(n * sizeof(struct arr_of_long));
for (net = 1; net <= channelNets; net++) {
- costMatrix[net] =
+ costMatrix[net].ptr =
malloc((channelTracks+2) * sizeof(long));
+ costMatrix[net].len = channelTracks+2;
}
}
Here, costMatrix has been converted from a nested pointer
to an array of structs, where each struct has a buffer ptr
and its associated length len. Whenever the buffers in
costMatrix are allocated or reassigned, the newly intro￾duced size field len must be updated accordingly.
Next, we present an example where annotating a buffer
with its bounds requires involved arithmetic reasoning within a
loop. Consider the following code where the loop runs longs
number of times with 4 bytes in the buffer buf accessed per
loop iteration:
static void byteReverse(
- unsigned char* buf,
+ arr<unsigned char> buf: count(longs * 4),
unsigned longs) {
uint32_t t;
do {
t = (uint32_t)
((unsigned) buf[3] << 8 | buf[2]) << 16 |
((unsigned) buf[1] << 8 | buf[0]);
*(uint32_t *) buf = t; buf += 4;
} while (--longs);
}
By analyzing this loop, we can conclude that buf has a
size of count(longs * 4). Existing tools [5] struggle to
infer bounds that have expressions with arithmetic. While the
above loop had deterministic behavior, the following is more
complicated.
struct bin_to_ascii_ret
vsf_ascii_bin_to_ascii(
- const char* p_in,
+ arr<const char> p_in: count(in_len),
- char* p_out,
+ arr<char> p_out: count(in_len * 2),
unsigned int in_len, int prev_cr) {
...
while (indexx < in_len) {
char the_char = p_in[indexx];
if (the_char == ’\n’ && last_char != ’\r’){
*p_out++ = ’\r’;
written++;
}
*p_out++ = the_char;
indexx++;
...
Here, the buffer p_in must be annotated with its length
in_len and, for memory safety, p_out must have a size
of (in_len*2) to handle the worst case loop behavior.
Often the annotation process is not local and requires
refactoring several functions. Consider the following code:
static int countint (lua_Integer key,
- unsigned int* nums
+ arr<unsigned int> nums: count(count_nums),
+ int count_nums
) {
unsigned int k = arrayindex(key);
if (k != 0) {
nums[luaO_ceillog2(k)]++;
...
Just looking at the original C code of countint, it is
impossible to annotate the buffer nums with its size. The
programmer likely has some custom invariant in mind to keep
the indexing within bounds. It is not possible to explain custom
invariants to the Checked C compiler. Thus, the idiomatic
way to enforce safety with Checked C is to introduce a new
argument count_nums that stores the array size and use it
to annotate nums, then require callers to pass the appropriate
size. Let’s consider a caller of countint next.
static int numusehash (
- const Table* t,
+ ptr<Table> t,
- unsigned int* nums,
+ arr<unsigned int> nums: count(count_nums),
+ int count_nums,
unsigned int* pna) {
...
- ause += countint(keyival(n),nums)
+ ause += countint(keyival(n),nums,count_nums)
...
Here, the call to countint must be modified to match
its new signature. Furthermore, numusehash must annotate
nums with its size in its signature. Accordingly, the signature
also needs an extra argument count_nums. Next, the callers
of numusehash also need to be updated to supply this extra
argument. We show one such caller next:
static void rehash(lua_State* L,
- Table* t, const TValue* ek
+ ptr<Table> t, ptr<const TValue> ek
) {
unsigned int nums[MAXABITS + 1];
...
- total += numusehash(t,nums,&na);
+ total += numusehash(t,nums,MAXABITS+1,&na);
...
- na += countint(ivalue(ek),nums);
+ na += countint(ivalue(ek),nums,MAXABITS+1);
...
}
In the above code, the new parameter count_nums is set to
its correct value MAXABITS+1 in the calls to countint and
numusehash. We are unaware of any prior tool that performs
such a whole program refactoring of C-code automatically.
III. BACKGROUND ON SYMBOLIC INFERENCE WITH 3C
3C [5] is a static-analysis-based tool to help developers
port C code to Checked C. It consists of two components, a
type inference algorithm called typ3c and a bounds inference
algorithm called boun3c, that are executed one after the
other. We briefly discuss these algorithms, their strengths and
limitations since MSA uses 3C.
typ3c uses type qualifier inference [7] to convert legacy
pointers to checked pointer types. Pointers that are used
unsafely, for instance, in unsafe casts (e.g., casting an int to
int*), are not converted to checked pointers. This is because
the Checked C compiler cannot provide safety guarantees for
such pointers. typ3c then classifies checked pointers into one
of ptr, arr, and nt_arr depending on their use.
Once the checked pointers have been identified, boun3c
infers bounds for arr and nt_arr pointers. It works by
constructing a dataflow graph that tracks the flow of arrays
along with their bounds, starting from their allocation site
where the bounds information is available. boun3c is designed
to be sound (i.e., inferred annotations are correct) but not
complete (not all possible annotation are inferred). In fact, as
our evaluation will show, boun3c misses several annotations.
One limitation of boun3c is that it can only infer bounds
that involve a single variable or a constant. Thus, bounds that
involve expressions with arithmetic will be missed for sure.
Further, boun3c is largely limited to inferring count-style
annotations, not bounds annotations that have both a lower
and upper bound. boun3c offers some heuristics that attempt
to come up with more annotations, but these annotations can
be unsound. Furthermore, in some cases, no good bound exists
without rewriting the program, which boun3c is not prepared
to do.
Note that 3C, as a combination of typ3c followed by
boun3c, does not attempt to fully port from C to Checked
C. The resulting code, for instance, is not guaranteed to
pass the Checked C compiler. This is because several bounds
annotations might still be missing, as well as some dynamic
casts might be necessary to pass the type checker of Checked
C. 3C is, thus, an assistance in the porting process. We carry
on with this design philosophy in this paper, striving to provide
even more assistance without guaranteeing a complete port to
Checked C.
IV. WHOLE-PROGRAM TRANSFORMATION WITH LLMS
As illustrated in Section II, the task of porting to Checked
C requires making several changes throughout the program.
Even with the increasing prompt sizes, it is still unreasonable
to expect entire code to fit inside a single prompt. Furthermore,
we found that even when we can fit larger parts of a program in
a single prompt, the accuracy of an LLM is lower when asked
to make several changes, compared to doing fewer changes to
a smaller piece of code (see Section VI).
The challenge then is to break a whole-program transfor￾mation into multiple smaller tasks. With LLMs, each infer￾ence query is treated independently of ones made previously,
therefore, any query on some part of the code must provide
enough context about the rest of the code in order to carry
out the task effectively. We address these challenges through
static analysis.
A. Dependency Graph Generation
We use a lightweight static analysis that goes across all
input source files and constructs a data structure that we
call as a dependency graph. Nodes of this graph are all the
top-level declarations in the program. These can either be
procedures (both its signature and its body), type declarations
(struct, union, enum), global variable declarations or
macro definitions. There is a directed edge from node n1 to
n2 if n2 is directly used by n1, as follows:
• Procedures. If n1 is a procedure, then we place out-going
edges from n1 to all procedures that are directly called
by it, as well as all types, globals and macros that appear
somewhere inside n1. We only consider direct calls. For
indirect calls through a function pointer, there will be an
edge to the type declaration of the pointer’s type, not to
potential targets of the pointer.
• Types. If n1 is a type definition, then we place out-going
edges to all types and macros that appear in the definition.
• Globals. If n1 is the declaration of a global variable, then
we place an out-going edge to the type of the variable or
any macro that the declaration might use.
 typedef struct {

 enum e f;

 ...

 } Typ

void foo(Typ p){

 p.f = MACRO

}

void bar() { 
 foo(g);

 }

enum e {

 ...

}

# define

 MACRO ...

Fig. 1: Example of a dependency graph
• Macros. There are no out-going edges from macros.
Transformation of macros is currently outside the scope
of our analysis. We didn’t find a need for it in our
experiments.
The requirements of this analysis are purposefully kept
simple for ease of implementation. We use clang to parse
and construct ASTs of all input source files. We then perform
linking at the AST level to resolve procedure calls and dump
the dependency graph; see Figure 1 for an example.
As part of this analysis, we also record additional informa￾tion for each node that can be obtained easily from its AST
representation. For instance, for a procedure, we keep track
of its signature, argument list, type of each argument, type of
each local variable, etc.
B. Generic Whole-Program Transformation
Porting to Checked C requires not just adding annotations,
but also supporting edits that allows for the presence of an
annotation in the first place. Inspired from previous experience
of porting C to Checked C (like in [1], [8], [5]), we define
three different programs transformations, which are applied
sequentially in order. Each of these transformation follow a
common structure, shown in Algorithm 1.

(T ), and outputs a new program that is the result of applying
T to the input program. The algorithm goes over the input
program one declaration at a time, and instructs an LLM to
preform a rewriting according to T .
The template of the LLM prompt is shown in Figure 2. It
consists of various sections. The first section is a preamble
on Checked C that defines its various annotations (e.g., arr),
their meaning (e.g., it is a pointer to an array) as well as the
syntax rules to follow (e.g., bounds annotation appears after a
colon).
The next section of the prompt (2) carries a description
of the task T (e.g., “infer bounds of arrays”). Next (3) is an
instruction telling the model that prior edits have been made to
the program, and it must edit the given snippet to respect those
refactorings. For instance, when a callee method signature is
modified, the call to that method must be modified as well.
Section 4 of the prompt defines an output format that the
model should follow. Instead of asking the model to produce
the entire modified code, prior work has found it useful to
instead ask for a “diff” or a patch that can be applied to the
original code. We simply follow the prompt used in prior work
[9] to obtain a patch from the LLM. Any other format or
formatting instructions can be used as well.
Section 5 of the prompt is an example of the task. For each
task, we only include one or two fixed hard-coded examples.
Section 6 of the prompt includes the relevant code snippets
from the input program. This includes context for the current
code (called “prelude”), the code that must be transformed

(code) as well as previous code refactorings (refactor history).
Finally, the prompt also includes some code-specific elements.
For instance, for the task of inferring bounds of arrays, we
explicitly list the variable names with array types in order to
help focus the attention of the model on those variables.
Getting back to Algorithm 1, it starts (lines 2 to 4) by
keeping track of the original code (oldcode) as well as
remembering what parts of the code have been refactored
(refactored), initially none. It then makes one pass over
all declarations in the code. These declarations are picked in
a bottom-up order, using a reverse topological sorting of the
dependency graph. In general, the dependency graph can have
cycles because of recursive types or recursive procedures; we
break these cycles arbitrarily in order to limit the transforma￾tion to a single pass over the program text.
For each declaration d, the prompt in instantiated with
task-specific as well as code-specific details. Code prelude
is computed as all immediate successors of d in D, i.e., all
code elements that are referenced directly in d. For brevity,
when including a procedure in the prelude, we only include
its signature and not its body. The refactor history includes all
changes made to these successors of d so far, if any.
When the LLM is prompted, it returns a patch (possibly
empty) that should be applied to d. We apply this patch to
update d. Finally, we set refactored[d] to true if the patch
was non-empty, i.e, d was updated. When d is a procedure,
we set refactored[d] to true only when the signature of d
was changed by the patch.
V. MSA DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION
The design of MSA is illustrated in Figure 3. The tool is a
combination of symbolic as well as LLM-based components.
As a design principle, we rely on symbolic components
whenever they exist or are easy to implement. Tasks that are
either complex to do symbolically (e.g. knowing if a code
pattern respects null-termination of a given array) or require
an LLM’s flexibility (e.g., refactoring to accommodate a new
struct field) are left to LLM-based components.
MSA feeds input C code to the 3C tool to produce partially￾converted CheckedC code. 3C is quite fast (especially com-
You are given a list of Checked C declarations and a
partially converted Checked C code snippet. Array of
arr<T> is not supported in Checked C. Your task
is to replace them with an array of struct having a
pointer field ’ptr’ and a bounds field ’len’. You will
also have to replace the uses of the nested array with
the uses of the struct ’ptr’ field instead. Make sure
to update the ’len’ field whenever the ’ptr’ field is
updated.
Fig. 4: Task description for replacing nested arrays with structs
From:
int foo(arr<arr<int>> a, int i) {
return a[i][i];
}
To:
// New struct
typedef struct arr_of_int {
arr<int> ptr : count(len);
int len;
} arr_of_int;
// type of a changes
int foo(arr<struct arr_of_int> a, int i) {
// nested pointer access via the ptr field
return a[i].ptr[i];
}

are included as well.
pared to LLM inference times), thus it serves us well to
use it as a source of cheap and sound annotations. We turn
off the heuristics in boun3c, which we observed to produce
incorrect annotations. We leave heuristics to the LLM-based
components of MSA. The role of MSA, thus, is to annotate the
unannotated checked pointers in the program produced by 3C.
MSA takes the output of 3C, constructs its dependency
graph, and uses it in subsequent LLM-based program trans￾formations. MSA is parametric on the choice of the LLM,
although we only evaluate with GPT4. In order to account for
the randomness in the LLM’s response, MSA asks for multiple
completions (i.e., responses) for each LLM query. The default
setting is 10, although it can be changed by the user depending
on their time budget. Multiple completions produce multiple
code patches; MSA takes a majority vote among these patches.
We now describe the three program transformation tasks.
A. Replacing Nested Arrays with Structs
As mentioned in Section II, the type arr<arr<T>> is not
allowed in Checked C syntax. The recommended way is to
replace it with arr<struct arr_of_T>, where struct
arr_of_T is a new structure with two fields, one of type
arr<T> for storing the inner array, and the other of type int
for storing the bound of this array. The rest of the program
should change to use this structure. For instance, the bounds
field must be updated when the corresponding array field is
set or updated.
Determine and assign ’count(..)’ or ’bounds(.., ..)’
expressions for each att and nt_arr in the
given function. To find valid bounds for a pointer p,
examine all uses of p and set bounds that encompass every
access. Alternatively, adopt the bounds from the pointer
from which p was assigned.
You will be provided a list of pointer variable names
along with their declaration line number. You must
choose one of the following rules for each of them.
[A0] Infer a valid bounds expression:
Provide a ’count(..)’ or ’bounds(..,..)’ expression
at the line of declaration. Choose this only when
you are completely sure that the bounds are valid.
[A1] Say unknown:
When there is not enough information to infer bounds
for a pointer, it is okay to leave the annotated line
same as the original line. Follow this by explaining
why enough information is not available. This can be
chosen when there is not a clear upper bound to all
accesses through the pointer or the pointer depends on
other pointers whose bounds are not known.
[A2] Change an arr to nt_arr:
If you cannot infer the bounds to arr p but you do
know that p is terminated with a null character from
its use, you can change its type to nt_arr.
Make sure to also change the pointers that p was
derived from to nt_arr in such a case. This can
also be due to a callee now taking nt_arr
instead of arr due to an earlier refactor.
[A3] Add a parameter for bounds:
If you cannot infer a reasonable bound for a pointer
parameter, add a new parameter to store its bounds and
use that in the bounds expression. Going ahead, all
calls of this function will have to be passed this
extra bounds argument.
Fig. 6: Task description for inferring bounds
Figure 4 shows the description for this task that is used
in conjunction with the template shown in Figure 2 to carry
out the program transformation. MSA first adds the declaration
of struct arr_of_T, once for each type T such that
the type arr<arr<T>> appears in the input program. This
step is done symbolically, at the AST level. MSA then uses
Algorithm 1 to carry out the required transformations in the
program to use this new type. Figure 5 shows the example
that is included in the prompt. The task-specific elements that
are included in the prompt are the names of variables with
refactored types (e.g., a for the example in Figure 5).
B. Inferring Bounds Annotations
The second transformation does the actual inference task
of adding bounds annotations for arr and nt_arr pointers.
The LLM is asked to annotate array pointers based on their
usage in the code snippet that is presented to it. Because
this pass traverses the code in a bottom-up fashion, when
the LLM is presented the code of a certain procedure, it will
also get presented with its context. This context will include
callee signatures, which have already been annotated because
they came before in the dependency-graph order. This allows
transitivity of the inferred annotations.
The task description for this transformation is the most
detailed among the three passes and is shown in Figure 6. It
From:
struct x { int f; int g; }
int foo(arr<struct x> a, int i) {
int j = a[i].f;
arr<struct x> p = a;
return a[j].f;
}
To:
// [A3] As j is read from the heap, the access
// a[j] could be anything. Moreover, j is not
// in scope at line 1. Since ’a’ is a pointer
// parameter, add a bounds parameter instead
// of saying ’unknown’.
int foo(arr<struct x> a : count(count_for_a),
int count_for_a, int i) {
int j = a[i].f;
// [A0] As p is assigned a, the bounds for a
// are valid for p too.
arr<struct x> p : count(count_for_a) = a;
return a[j].f;
}
From:
void foo() {
char a[10]; nt_arr<char> p = a;
}
To:
void foo() {
char a[10];
// [A0] When an array is converted to nt_arr
// the count is the size of the array - 1.
nt_arr<char> p : count(9) = a;
}
Fig. 7: Examples of inferring bounds for arr and nt_arr
lists down four different rules (A0—A3). The first rule (A0)
is for inferring bounds “when the model is sure of it” and the
second rule (A1) provides an escape hatch for the same. The
idea behind A1 is to reduce hallucinations when the model
is not confident of inferring bounds; that is, the model should
choose to leave things unannotated rather than add an incorrect
one. The third rule (A2) rectifies inaccuracies in typ3c where
it fails to identify that certain arrays are null-terminated. In
our experience, we found that this happens because typ3c is
sometimes unable to identify that a comparison to the null
character is being used to break out of a loop through the
array. In other cases, it lacks an understanding of standard
string operations (from stdlib), which also establish that
a given array is (intended to be) null-terminated. An LLM
can compensate for these limitations by promoting arr to
nt_arr, helping gain information about the length of the
array. Finally, the last rule (A3) instructs the model that if
the bound of a parameter is not obvious from its use in the
code, then it should add a new parameter to the procedure,
and pass the obligation to the callers (which are yet to
undergo transformation) to pass the appropriate bounds in the
newly added parameter. Note that the prompt only says what
annotations it wants, it does not say how to obtain them. The
complexity of actually doing program analysis is completely
You are given a Checked C code snippet, with a history of
refactors. The refactors introduce a new variable to
store the bounds of a pointer variable, which can be a
struct field or a global variable. Update the newly
introduced bounds variable with the correct bounds
whenever its corresponding pointer variable is assigned a
new value. Make the update in the same statement as the
assignment.
Fig. 8: Task description for adding new bounds variables
left to the model.
Figure 7 shows two examples that are provided to the
model. The first example shows applications of rules A0 and
A3 for arr, and the latter example shows an application
of rule A0 for nt_arr, where it makes a note of the off￾by-one computation for bounds of null-terminated arrays. In
terms of program elements that are provided in the prompt
of Figure 2, we give variable names of all arr and nt_arr
typed variables that are currently unannotated.
MSA follows Algorithm 1 with the above task description
to make changes to the program, with a few minor changes.
It restricts the bottom-up traversal to only the procedures in
the program, not the other top-level declarations. That is, it
goes bottom-up on the program call graph. As mentioned in
Section IV, we break cycles in the call graph arbitrarily. This
implies that the inference accuracy can suffer for mutually
recursive procedures. It is an interesting future work to in￾vestigate the use of a fix-point iteration over the mutually￾recursive cycle to improve accuracy. Further, when looking
at a particular procedure p, the model is also allowed to
add annotations on any globals or struct fields that p uses,
which are anyway present in the prelude of p. Finally, globals
and struct fields can be used in multiple procedures, each of
which are only considered one-by-one. Thus, it is possible
that different procedures produce conflicting annotations for
globals or struct fields. In this case, MSA detects this conflict in
a post-processing step and drops the corresponding annotation.
These missing annotations are left for the third transformation
that follows next.
C. Annotating Globals and Struct Fields
Annotations for global variables as well as struct fields have
a global scope. That is, these annotations are expected to
hold throughout the lifetime of the program. Consequently,
it is possible that the previous pass, which only consider one
procedure at a time, fails to infer a consistent bound for them.
In these cases, the third pass takes over.
MSA creates a new variable for storing the bounds of the
respectively element. In particular, it creates a new int-valued
global variable called count_for_g for each global variable
g of type arr that is unannotated so far. It adds the annotation
count(count_for_g) to the declaration of g. MSA also
creates a new int-valued field called count_for_f for field
f (in the same struct) of type arr that is unannotated so
far. It adds the annotation count(count_for_f) to the
field f. These changes are made symbolically by MSA and
From:
void foo(arr<struct x> a, int i) {
a[i].p = malloc(sizeof(int) * 10);
}
To:
struct x {
int count_for_p;
arr<int> p: count(count_for_p);
}
void foo(arr<struct x> a, int i){
a[i].p = malloc(sizeof(int) * 10),
a[i].count_for_p = 10;
}
Fig. 9: Example of transformation for globals and struct fields
added to the refactor history. MSA then runs Algorithm 1 with
the task description shown in Figure 8. This transformation
instructs the model to update the bounds variable each time the
corresponding array is assigned. Figure 9 shows the example
that is provided in the prompt. In terms of program elements,
MSA provides the names of the global variables and struct
fields for whom the additional variables have been introduced.
VI. EVALUATION
In this section we evaluate MSA empirically. We use gpt-
4-32k from Azure OpenAI Service as the LLM in these
experiments. We divide our experiments into two categories:
(a) benchmarking effectiveness of the different components
of our algorithm and the prompt template, and (b) evaluating
the effectiveness of MSA in inferring Checked C annotations
in real-world codebases. We also present our experience on
porting vsftpd, one of our real-world benchmarks, end-to-end.
A. Benchmarking the MSA algorithm
We vary different components of our algorithm and compare
the results to show their relative effectiveness. We consider:
(a) the background about Checked C and specific inference
instructions in the prompt template, and (b) modular inference
with dependency-order traversal of the codebase.
For this experiment, we use a subset of the Olden [10] and
Ptrdist [11] benchmarks, with code sizes that allow the entire
program to fit in a single prompt. For large codebases, modular
inference is a necessity, however, we explore if modularity
helps even for small programs that may fit in a single prompt.
We define a trivial algorithm that uses a prompt, consisting of
some instructions followed by a full C program, and queries
the LLM to obtain its output. Within this algorithm, we vary
the instructions part of the prompt with the following versions:
• V0: no background on Checked C or specific inference
instructions to the LLM,
• V1: background on Checked C and inference instructions,
as explained in Section IV.
Version V0’s performance was extremely poor, with the
LLM often bailing out either by citing the problem as too hard

or by saying there are no pointers to be annotated. Results for
V1 and MSA are shown in Table I (it also shows numbers for
boun3c). For each benchmark, the table shows the total number
of bounds annotations required, the number of annotations
inferred by the algorithm (Inf), and the number of correct
annotations amongst them (Correct). For determining which
of the inferred annotations are correct, we manually prepare
annotated versions of these benchmarks that compile with the
Checked C compiler and pass the runtime tests. Then, an
inferred annotation is defined to be correct if it matches the
manual annotation in these ground-truth versions.
As the table shows, while MSA correctly infers 86% of the
annotations on-average, the non-modular version V1 infers
only 35%. There are 5 cases across these benchmarks where
refactoring instructions—absent from V1 but present in MSA—
play a role. Otherwise, the only difference is modular analysis.
Conclusion. Without the Checked C background and infer￾ence instructions in the prompt, LLMs cannot infer annotations
even for small programs. With instructions, modular analysis
is more effective than fitting the entire (small) program in a
prompt. Thus, it is better to focus LLM on one procedure at
a time, providing it the dependencies in the context.
B. Inferring annotations in real-world codebases
Table II shows the details of real-world benchmarks that we
picked from 3C experiments [5], where 3C could not infer a
reasonable number of annotations. These benchmarks cover a

variety of different domains (language interpreter, http server,
ftp server, media server, compression library, etc.) and come
from a list recommended by the Checked C community [12].
For each benchmark, the table shows the size of the benchmark
(in terms of lines of code), total number of pointers that
required an annotation (RB), the number of pointers annotated
by boun3c (b3c), additional pointers that boun3c heuristics in￾fer (b3ch), and the number of remaining unannotated pointers
(RB - b3c). We discount the boun3c heuristics from rest of
our experiments; first, the number of additional annotations
that they infer over boun3c is not substantial, and second, on
manual inspection, nearly a third of them seemed incorrect
to us. Hence, we consider Remaining as the target for MSA.
For libarchive, we ran MSA on the whole codebase, but
analyzed only a subset of the annotations for correctness (150
unannotated pointers), due to time constraints.
Figure 10 plots the performance of MSA on these bench￾marks. We categorize the inferred annotations into Correct
and Incorrect based on a manual inspection of the inferred
annotations. In total, MSA infers 877 annotations across all
benchmarks, out of which 797 annotations are correct and
80 are incorrect. Thus, MSA correctly infers 86% of the
annotations remaining after boun3c (797/922). Of the 797
correctly inferred annotations, 212 are array pointer bound
annotations (78% of remaining array pointer bounds) while
585 are NT array bounds annotations (90% of remaining NT
array bounds); of these 585 NT array annotations, 532 (91%)
are count(0) annotations whereas only 9% (26/272) of
the array pointer bounds annotations missed by boun3c are
count(0).
Below is a code snippet from icecast that shows a couple
of annotations that MSA infers but boun3c could not:
// MD5Update(...,
// arr<char> buf:count(n), int n);
//
// util_bin_to_hex(..., int n)
// : nt_arr<char> count (n * 2);
nt_arr<char> get_hash
(const char *data: nt_arr<char>, int len) {
...
MD5Update(&context, data, len); ...
return (util_bin_to_hex(digest, 16));
}
MSA constructs the context for get_hash, shown as com￾ments, and from this information, it is able to infer that data

is unable to infer the return type annotation because it is not
able to infer the n*2 annotation for util_bin_to_hex (it
doesn’t support arithmetic expressions in annotations). It is
also unable to infer annotations for data as one of the call
sites for get_hash is get_hash(p, strlen(p)), and
boun3c is unable to correlate the two parameters of the call.
Following is an example from thttpd where MSA suc￾cessfully changes an arr annotation from typ3c to nt_arr.
static void defang(arr<char> str, ...) {
arr<char> cp1 = (void *) 0;
for(cp1 = str; *cp1 != ’\0’; cp1++) {
// access *cp1
}
Here, typ3c marks the str argument and cp1 as
arr<char>. However, analyzing the access patterns
(loop iterating until the null character), MSA infers an
nt_arr<char> type with count(0) annotation for both of
them. There were also multiple instances when MSA refactors
the code to allow additional annotations. For example:
void luaL_setfuncs (arr<const luaL_Reg> l) {
for (; l->name != NULL; l++) { ... }
}
In this function, from lua, the array pointer l is incremented
until its name field is NULL. Since there is no reason￾able annotation for it in the code as written, MSA adds a
bounds argument l_count to the function and the annotation
count(l_count) to l.
Out of the 877 annotations that MSA infers, 80 (9%) are
incorrect. Most of these are subtle cases where pointers are
accessed with unusual patterns. E.g., in the following snippet
from lua, the pointer is accessed with a negative index:
copy2buff(StkId top:arr<StackValue>, int n) {
do {
// use *(top - n)
} while (--n > 0);
}
MSA infers count(n) for the top pointer, whereas the
correct annotation would be bound(top - n, top). Im￾proving performance on such code patterns is future work.
The annotations that MSA does not infer (45/922) are mostly
due to the A1 rule of Figure 6. In very few cases, the LLM
produced annotations that referred to variables that are not
in scope; these are dropped automatically by MSA as a post￾processing step.
Table III shows the number of function call and globals
and struct refactorings that MSA applies per benchmark. The
column Functions includes both the number of function pa￾rameters added as well as modifications to respective function
calls. Similarly, the column for globals and structs include
both the number of global variables and struct fields added
as well as their corresponding assignments. For real-world
codebases, the nested pointers to struct transformation did not
appear (while one case of this appears in Table I).
Table III also shows the number of LLM queries required
per benchmark, and the average number of input and output
tokens (including all completions) per query.
Conclusion. When porting real-world codebases to Checked
C, 3C leaves a substantial number of pointers unannotated.
MSA is able to infer majority of these pointers (86% in our
experiments). We observe that MSA is able to infer annotations
that require sophisticated code reasoning. We also observe
that porting is not just about inferring annotations; code edits,
function refactorings, globals and struct refactoring are also
commonplace. Their support in MSA is important for real￾world codebases.
C. vsftpd: End-to-end case study
We present a case study on end-to-end porting of vsftpd.
In this exercise, we take the output of MSA and make further
edits so that it successfully compiles with Checked C. We
started by reverting the incorrect annotations and adding the
missing annotations in the MSA output. This includes the red
and blue regions in the vsftpd bar in Figure 10; we corrected
3 incorrect annotations requiring 6 edits and added 8 missing
annotations requiring 22 edits. The remaining work involved
passing the Checked C compiler. For that, we had to change
a further 148 lines in the code. These changes are the known
caveats in making a codebase compile with Checked C [13].
For example, we had to add dynamic bound casts (that are
checked at runtime) and assume casts, when the Checked C
compiler could not reason about the bounds due to, e.g., lack
of flow-sensitivity. An example is as follows:
// p : nt_arr<char> count(0)
if (p[0] != ’-’)
{...}
else
{ // access p[1] }
In the else branch, accessing p[1] is safe because we
know that p is an nt_arr and that p[0] is not null. However,
the Checked C compiler is unable to reason about this, so we
added an assume bound cast to bypass the checker. In a few
other cases, the code was using the same pointer variable to
represent different sized arrays. For such cases, we added new
variables for differently sized arrays so that all variables are
used in a bound-consistent manner. Once the code compiled,
we were able to run the executable and start the FTP server.
We were prepared to debug any runtime crashes due to failed
checks inserted by Checked C (this can be caused either by a
real memory-safety violation in the code, or due to incorrect
dynamic casts). However, we did not encounter any such cases.
Conclusion. Although this was only one case study, our
experience showed that MSA annotation indeed helped. MSA
roughly performed 58% of the work requires for end-to-end
porting (250/426 edits). It inferred 123 annotations correctly
which led to 250 edits, leaving 11 annotations for manual
work, requiring 28 edits. In contrast, manually adding all the
112 annotations missed by 3C would have required much
more effort. Further 148 edits were required to make the
code compile; these edits were the easiest conceptually. We
acknowledge that further work is required in this space to
make a claim on end-to-end porting.
VII. THREATS TO VALIDITY
One potential threat to validity is data contamination, if the
Checked C versions of programs were part of the training data
of the LLM. Given our use of LLMs from OpenAI, whose
training data is not publicly known, there is no good way
to completely rule it out. We note that Checked C versions
of icecast, thttpd and vsftpd are indeed available
publicly. However, there are no publicly available Checked
C versions of lua and libarchive, to the best of our
knowledge. The results across these benchmarks are largely
consistent. Further, the LLM demonstrates poor knowledge of
Checked C, unable to carry out the task without a background
(V0, Section VI). Our contribution of whole-program trans￾formations in a modular fashion stands, irrespective of data
contamination (V1 vs. MSA, Section VI). Also, Checked C
code is extremely rare compared to other languages.
Another internal threat is our manual assessment of the
correctness of annotations produced by MSA. We counter this
by having multiple authors make independent assessment, then
discussing to reach consensus. In some cases (Table I and
Section VI-C), we validate correctness using the compiler, and
found that our assessments were indeed correct.
An external threat to validity is that GPT4 can get updated
over time by OpenAI, changing the performance of MSA. We
also make no claim on the results that will be obtained with
other LLMs.
VIII. RELATED WORK
There are several approaches for memory safety. One set of
tools use binary instrumentation to ensure safety of memory
accesses [14], [15], [16]. These do not require recompilation,
but suffer from high performance overheads. Overheads are
lower for source-level instrumentation tools, at the cost of
needing recompilation, but still high enough to prohibit pro￾duction use [17], [18], [19]. Cyclone [3] is a safe dialect of
C that extends pointers with labels (ordinary, never-null, and
fat) and uses them to instrument safety checks. Deputy [2]
provides bounded pointers and tagged unions. Checked C takes
inspiration from this line of work and goes much further in
building a production-ready compiler [20].
There has been a flurry of recent work in using LLMs
to help improve the productivity of software developers. Our
work builds along in this direction, while focusing specifically
on memory safety through a safe C dialect. We are unaware of
prior LLM-based (or ML-based) work for this problem; and
we have already presented a detailed comparion against 3C,
the state-of-the-art symbolic tool for this problem.
LLMs have been extensively used for program synthe￾sis [21], [22], [23], [24], [25], including both code generation
(generating a program from a natural language description)
and completion (automatically completing an incomplete code
fragment). Recent auto-completion systems are even able to
operate across files within a repository [26]. There have
also been proposals that use LLMs to synthesize repair
patches [27], [28], [29], surpassing the capabilities of current
automated program repair tools. In the direction of software
security, Pearce et al. [30] train their own GPT2 model to eval￾uate the efficacy of LLMs at generating and repairing software
vulnerabilities. Their study is restricted to small “vulnerability
patterns” that lead to well-known CWE/CVEs. In the space of
LLMs for software engineering, our contribution on whole￾program transformations, with the ability of making several
correlated edits to a program using a simple task description,
is novel. We refer the reader to survey papers [31], [32] for
more work on leveraging LLMs for software engineering.
There is also a series of work that explores the synergy of
LLMs with program analysis. Llift [33] combines LLMs with
static analysis tools to identify use-before-initialization bugs in
the Linux kernel. Lemur [34] uses LLMs to infer loop invari￾ants that are validated by a symbolic verifier. However, Lemur
is evaluated only on small benchmarks that fit in a single LLM
prompt. Our whole program transformation framework and
techniques should be applicable to loop invariant inference as
well. Chakroborty et al. [35] develop techniques to rank LLM￾generated candidate loop invariants. It is an interesting future
work to investigate if similar rankers can be developed for
ranking LLM-generated candidates for Checked C annotations.
IX. CONCLUSION
Large Language Models have demonstrated promising ca￾pabilities for software engineering tasks. Tools like Github
Copilot are used by millions of developers. However, for
reliability of the LLM-generated code, the developers are
on their own. On the other side, formal verification tools
provide strong guarantees but are difficult to deploy on a
large scale. They require annotations, program refactorings,
etc. to be effective. Combining LLM program comprehension
capabilities with formal verification tools provides best of both
the worlds. While tedious tasks of annotating and refactoring
code can be delegated to LLMs, they need not be trusted—
formal verification tools can do the validation. In this paper,
we have presented a general framework to combine LLMs
with formal verification tools, instantiated with the concrete
problem of inferring memory safety annotations. On our
benchmarks, we find that LLMs are able to reason about the
code to generate annotations, refactoring the code as and when
required. Still, they are outside the Trusted Computing Base as
the Checked C compiler catches any LLM mistakes (statically
or at runtime). We invite the community to further explore the
synergy between formal methods and LLMs.
